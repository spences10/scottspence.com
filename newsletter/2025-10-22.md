## Opening

October's been quite the month for shipping. I've been deep in the
weeds with database issues, AI tooling optimisation, and a pretty
significant newsletter infrastructure overhaul. Plus, there's a CRM
project that's consumed a fair bit of my time (more on that shortly).
Let's dive in.

## Highlights

### Automated Newsletter Generation

I've completely revamped how I generate these newsletters. Instead of
manual curation, I've built an automated system that pulls GitHub
activity data and uses Claude to synthesise it into readable prose.
The
[workflow now lives in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/spences10/scottspence.com/commit/ec4415683457efab3fc2042e3d67c2879b96c430),
collecting commits, PRs, and releases, then feeding them to an agent
for generation. It's still in beta (hence this being a somewhat meta
newsletter about newsletters), but the goal is to make the process
more scalable and consistent.

### Claude Skills CLI v0.0.6

Released several updates to
[claude-skills-cli](https://github.com/spences10/claude-skills-cli),
adding a stats command and improving skill validation with progressive
disclosure checks. The tool now better guides users through the skill
creation process and provides clearer feedback on what's missing.

### Dev Hub CRM: A Month of Foundation Building

The [devhub-crm](https://github.com/spences10/devhub-crm) project has
seen substantial progress. I've implemented core authentication with
Better Auth, built out full contact management (create, read, update,
delete), added interactions and follow-ups tracking, and even GitHub
OAuth integration. There's now a QR code feature for sharing profiles,
tag management, and comprehensive settings for user preferences. The
UI uses DaisyUI v5 and includes a demo mode for testing. It's been a
marathon of feature work, but the foundation is solid now.

## Technical Deep Dives

### SQLite Corruption with fs.copyFile() in WAL Mode

I discovered an issue with my site's popular posts footer display and
traced it back to database corruption caused by using `fs.copyFile()`
on a SQLite database in WAL mode. I wrote a
[detailed post](https://scottspence.com/posts/sqlite-corruption-fs-copyfile-issue)
about the problem, the symptoms, and how to recover from it. The key
learning: WAL files are essential for database integrity and bypassing
SvelteKit's proper file handling can cause corruption. I've since
implemented proper backup functionality to prevent this.

### Optimising MCP Server Context Usage in Claude Code

I was horrified to discover my MCP tools were consuming 66,000+ tokens
before I even started a Claude Code session.
[This post](https://scottspence.com/posts/optimising-mcp-server-context-usage-in-claude-code)
covers the investigation and solutions for reducing MCP context
overhead—essential reading if you're using multiple MCP servers with
Claude.

### Newsletter Infrastructure

Built out the complete newsletter pipeline: GitHub activity fetching
via API, integration with Anthropic's Claude for content generation,
scheduled reminders (first of the month at 9am via cron), and
newsletter sending through Resend. The system now handles Turnstile
CAPTCHA verification for contact forms and manages subscriber
tracking. It's quite the stack, but it automates the painful parts.

## Open Source & Releases

Released multiple versions of
[@sveltejs/mcp](https://github.com/sveltejs/mcp) (0.0.2 through
0.1.8), continuing to iterate on the Svelte integration for Model
Context Protocol. Also shipped updates to
[mcp-omnisearch](https://github.com/spences10/mcp-omnisearch) with
enhanced web search operators and
[mcp-sqlite-tools](https://github.com/spences10/mcp-sqlite-tools) with
better multi-statement SQL support.

Migrated several MCP servers (mcp-wsl-exec, mcp-sequentialthinking-qa)
to use TMCP and improved their validation with Valibot. The ecosystem
is moving toward more consistent tooling.

## What's Coming

The Dev Hub CRM still needs polish—better error handling, more social
link integrations, and some performance optimisation for large contact
lists. I'm also planning to open-source more of the MCP infrastructure
work and continue iterating on newsletter generation based on
feedback.

There's also a backlog of small improvements across the MCP ecosystem
and probably another deep dive post on something I've learned this
month. Database resilience seems like a theme worth exploring further.

## Closing

This month reinforced how much infrastructure work enables better
product work. Fixing the newsletter pipeline and database issues
created space for shipping Dev Hub features without the constant
nagging feeling that something's broken somewhere. Here's to
October—chaotic, productive, and full of learning.

Until next month.
