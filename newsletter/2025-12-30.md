December was one of those months where the private work felt like the
main event but the side projects told the more interesting story.
Between building infrastructure for AI agents at work and spinning up
everything from browser extensions to newsletter tooling at home, I
managed to squeeze 539 commits across 64 repositories into the
calendar. The split was roughly even between client work and personal
projects, which feels about right when you're trying to keep both
plates spinning.

The month had a theme: infrastructure. Whether it was building
Langfuse telemetry into runtime environments, wrestling with SQLite
analytics that could keep up with real traffic, or setting up content
pipelines for workshop platforms, most of December was spent on the
plumbing that makes everything else possible. Not glamorous, but
deeply satisfying when it works.

I also spent considerable time building tools for myself - a pattern
that's become increasingly important. When you're working with AI
assistance daily, having the right scaffolding makes everything
faster.

## Highlights

December brought several substantial pieces of work across both client
projects and personal tooling. The analytics work alone represents
weeks of iteration, whilst the workshop platform finally came together
after months of planning.

## Local Analytics with SQLite

The standout technical achievement this month was building a complete
analytics system from scratch. After years with Fathom Analytics, I
wanted something more integrated - live visitor counts, popular posts,
real-time traffic breakdowns without external API calls. What started
as a simple tracking experiment evolved into an analytics engine that
handles thousands of pageviews daily.

The system uses SQLite for storage with a queue-based ingestion
pipeline that batches writes to avoid blocking requests. Added user
agent parsing for browser and device detection, IP-to-country mapping
using Cloudflare headers, and bot detection to keep the data clean.
The database schema includes indices for common queries and a rollup
mechanism for historical data aggregation.

Most interesting was solving the over-fetching problem on the posts
route. Initially every visit triggered analytics queries that slowed
everything down. Fixed it by implementing feature flags, optimising
query patterns, and adding server-side caching. The live visitors
component now updates every 15 seconds without dragging down page
loads. Full write-up published at
[Local Analytics with SQLite and SvelteKit](https://scottspence.com/posts/local-analytics-with-sqlite-and-sveltekit).

## Svelte Bits Workshop Platform

The workshop platform project reached a milestone this month. Built
the complete checkout flow using Polar, integrated Better Auth for
authentication with email/password and social providers, and set up
the database schema for courses, tutorials, and user enrolments. The
content system supports both video tutorials (with timestamps and
resource links) and workshops (with GitHub repos and live session
scheduling).

Added SEO configuration across all pages using svead, implemented
role-based access control for premium content, and built admin tooling
for managing workshops and inquiries. The architecture uses SvelteKit
with Turso for the database, Cloudflare Turnstile for spam protection,
and Resend for transactional emails. The whole thing deploys to
Railway with automated database backups and pull/push functionality.

## Client Infrastructure Work

On the client side, built substantial infrastructure for AI agent
systems. Implemented Langfuse telemetry with OpenTelemetry integration
for distributed tracing, set up AWS Bedrock support alongside
Anthropic's API for model flexibility, and consolidated agent variants
into a single deployable runtime with environment-based configuration.
The Docker builds required careful dependency management and caching
strategies to keep image sizes reasonable.

Added real-time capabilities for agent interactions, built HTTP proxy
support for shadow mode testing, and improved error handling across
the stack. Also helped migrate UI components and optimise state
management patterns, which meant lots of refactoring and testing to
ensure nothing broke in production.

## Blog Posts

Two posts this month, both documenting technical decisions that felt
worth sharing. The analytics piece captures months of iteration
distilled into practical patterns, whilst the Linux post records a
brief detour into distro evaluation.

## Building Self-Hosted Analytics

The SQLite analytics post walks through the entire system
architecture - from request tracking hooks to query optimisation to
maintenance tasks. Covers visitor anonymisation with salted hashes,
concurrent write handling, and how to structure indices for real-time
queries. The deduplication logic alone took several iterations to get
right, and the post includes the final working solution.

Most valuable section might be the performance optimisation part.
Explains how to batch inserts, avoid N+1 queries, and implement
feature flags for gradual rollout. Also details the migration strategy
from external analytics providers and how to maintain both systems
during transition.

## Linux Distribution Hopping

Spent a weekend evaluating new Linux distributions after my existing
setup felt stale. Tried Omarchy with its tiling window manager for
about 16 hours before admitting defeat - couldn't wrap my head around
the keyboard-driven workflow. Switched to EndeavourOS instead, which
gave me Arch's rolling release model without the installation pain.
The post captures the reasoning and migration process for anyone
considering similar moves.

## Open Source

Released several tools this month, mostly focused on developer
workflows and AI integration. The Claude-related projects saw the most
activity, with MCP servers and skills repositories getting regular
updates and community contributions.

## Svalettab Browser Extension

Built a browser extension that generates random colour palettes and
font pairings for new tabs. Uses variable fonts from Fontsource,
implements contrast checking for accessibility, and includes a
click-to-copy feature for colour values. The trickiest part was
supporting both Chrome and Firefox with their different extension APIs
whilst maintaining a single codebase.

Took styling cues from Palettab but rebuilt everything in Svelte 5
with runes. Added the dimple divider effect using SVG paths, smooth
fade-in animations, and hover states that show font source links. The
extension doesn't track anything or use external APIs - everything
happens client-side. Available in both Chrome Web Store and Firefox
Add-ons.

## CCLog Tool and Claude Skills

Created cclog, a tool for syncing Claude Code chat history to SQLite
for analysis. Handles the JSON export format, tracks tool calls and
results, and structures everything for SQL queries. Wrote it in Bun
for speed and the Bun native SQLite.

Extended my svelte-claude-skills repository with comprehensive
documentation on reactivity patterns, migration gotchas from Svelte 4
to 5, and remote function usage. Added skill activation hooks,
research verification guidelines, and detailed examples of async
integration patterns. The repository now serves as reference
documentation for anyone building Claude Code extensions.

## MCPick Profiles Feature

Added profiles support to mcpick, allowing predefined sets of MCP
servers to be installed as groups. Useful for different work
contexts - one profile for web development, another for data analysis,
etc. Also implemented `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` support for custom config
locations and fixed several edge cases in the installation flow.

The profiles feature came from a community suggestion and got merged
within days. Added error handling, shell injection protection, and
scope support for scoped npm packages. Most satisfying bit was the
clean abstraction that made the feature feel natural within the
existing command structure.
