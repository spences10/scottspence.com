Hey there!

You're getting this because you signed up for my newsletter at some
point. Firstly, thanks! Secondly, I've migrated everything from
Buttondown over to Resend. I wanted to reach out to tell you this
before I start sending the regular newsletter.

So, **if you're not interested in receiving these emails from me
anymore, absolutely no worries.** Here's the link to unsubscribe.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0;">
  <a href="{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}" style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 28px; background-color: #0066cc; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;">Unsubscribe</a>
</div>

Still here? Brilliant!

June 2024 was the last time I sent out a newsletter.

I've been pants at sending regular updates. Classic case of "I should
really sort that newsletter out" whilst never actually sorting it out.
This fresh start with Resend is me properly committing to keeping you
in the loop (again ðŸ˜…).

**What you can expect:**

I write about web development stuff â€“ mainly SvelteKit, TypeScript,
and whatever tech problems I'm currently solving (or creating for
myself, let's be real). You'll get updates when I publish new posts,
or I'm building something I want to share.

I'm going to try keep it to monthly updates, it'll mainly be a mix of
stuff I've come across on Bluesky and what I've been building and
sharing things that have generally made my life easier as a developer.

Want to check out what I've been up to in the meantime? Head over to
[scottspence.com](https://scottspence.com) â€“ there's a bunch of stuff
I've written about since the last newsletter.

Cheers, Scott
