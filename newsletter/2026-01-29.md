Aight! First up, apologies for the rundown last month! I got the
feedback, yes, I use AI to collate this newsletter, if I didn't then
I'd never send one! 😅 Last month I just ran the gen script and sent
it, bc, busy, end of year and I didn't have a great deal of time to
edit it! So, ready for a rundown of what I have been doing this month?
Again, I use Claude (Opus) to gather all my GitHub commits and blog
posts for the last 30 days!

January (as most moths now to beer eel) was more Claude Code workflow
and tooling. I made two marketplaces for the skills I use with Claude
Code on the regular.

- [claude-code-toolkit](https://github.com/spences10/claude-code-toolkit)
  for general-purpose skills, the forced evaluation hook (to make
  skills activate when you need them) is included in this one.
- [svelte-skills-kit](https://github.com/spences10/svelte-skills-kit)
  for SvelteKit-specific patterns

I've made ecosystem skill in them is to plug my tools that I use in my
AI toolbelt (ugh!).

The toolkit includes things like research, which will when needed
clone a repo to gather details locally rather than randomly searching
using web search. I added a reflect skill, so I can be all like "let's
review all the shit you got wrong to make sure it doesn't happen
again" other tools that I've probably already mentioned a load are
bundled in there too.

## Client Work

Busy month at XtendOps:

- Agent telemetry improvements
- Feature work on internal tooling modules
- UI/UX improvements across the platform
- Built Claude Code skills for automated dependency management
- Infrastructure and observability improvements

## Blog Posts

Three I'll mention here:

- [Unlock Swarm Mode in Claude Code with claude-sneakpeek](https://scottspence.com/posts/unlock-swarm-mode-in-claude-code)
- [Organising Claude Code Skills Into Plugin Marketplaces](https://scottspence.com/posts/organising-claude-code-skills-into-plugin-marketplaces)
- [Migrating Off Of Fathom Analytics](https://scottspence.com/posts/migrating-off-fathom-analytics)

The Claude Code team mode (swarm) I've literally started using
yesterday and, well, from initial use I'm going to favour this over a
Ralph loop to be honest.

## Open Source

**Skills Ecosystem** - Three repos working together:

- [claude-code-toolkit](https://github.com/spences10/claude-code-toolkit) -
  General-purpose skills: research (clones repos locally),
  skill-creator, plugin-dev, self-improving skills, forced evaluation
  hook
- [svelte-skills-kit](https://github.com/spences10/svelte-skills-kit) -
  SvelteKit patterns: LayerChart skill, template directives for
  `@attach`, auth references, data flow
- [claude-skills-cli](https://github.com/spences10/claude-skills-cli) -
  CLI for creating skills with progressive disclosure validation

**Ralph Loop Tooling:**

- [ralph-town](https://github.com/spences10/ralph-town) - Ralph loop
  with gas limits in containers. Monorepo with `@ralph-town/core` +
  CLI (run, init, validate). Added mcp-ralph-town server, skills
  marketplace, devcontainers and local runtimes support, THIS IS
  REFERENCE MATERIAL NOW! With Claude Code new orchestration mode
  incoming this is already obsolete! 😅

**This Site:**

- Live visitor stats feature
- All-time analytics rollup fix
- Bot pattern improvements for cleaner data

**Maintained:**

- [cclog](https://github.com/spences10/cclog) - Sync Claude Code
  transcripts to SQLite. Added compiled binary releases via GH Actions
- [svalettab](https://github.com/spences10/svalettab) - Palettab
  replacement. More fonts, disable loading animation, automated
  releases
- [svelte.london](https://github.com/svelte-society/svelte.london) -
  Switched to Guild API for events
- [mcp-omnisearch](https://github.com/spences10/mcp-omnisearch) -
  Unified MCP search server updates
