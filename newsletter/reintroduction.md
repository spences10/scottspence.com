Hey there!

So, bit of an awkward one â€“ you're getting this because you signed up
for my newsletter at some point, and I've just migrated everything
from Buttondown over to Resend. I wanted to reach out properly rather
than just dropping random emails.

First things first: **if you're not interested anymore, absolutely no
worries.** One click and you're done. No guilt trips, no "are you
sure?" nonsense. Life's too short for inbox clutter you don't want.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0;">
  <a href="{{{RESEND_UNSUBSCRIBE_URL}}}" style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 28px; background-color: #0066cc; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;">Unsubscribe</a>
</div>

Still here? Brilliant!

I'll be honest â€“ I've been pants at sending regular updates. Classic
case of "I should really sort that newsletter out" whilst never
actually sorting it out. But that's changing. This fresh start with
Resend is me properly committing to keeping you in the loop (again
ðŸ˜…).

**What you can expect:**

I write about web development stuff â€“ mainly SvelteKit, TypeScript,
and whatever tech problems I'm currently solving (or creating, let's
be real). You'll get updates when I publish new posts, share
observations from building things, and occasionally ramble about
performance optimisation because I'm a bit obsessed with making
websites fast.

No spam, no daily bombardment. Just genuine updates when I've actually
got something worth sharing. If I'm working on something interesting
or I've learned something that might help you avoid the mistakes I've
made, you'll hear about it.

I genuinely appreciate you sticking around through my frankly
embarrassing newsletter silence. This time I'm actually going to use
the bloody thing.

Want to check out what I've been up to in the meantime? Head over to

I've written that you might find useful.

Cheers, Scott
