title: 'The Claude Skills Month - November 2025'

So, November was Claude Code skills, mainly! What started as
frustration with skills that wouldn't activate became an investigation
into why they weren't working, how to fix it, and eventually building
tooling so others don't have to go through the same ballache I did. 😅

Alongside this, client work continued at pace with some substantial
infrastructure and performance work on the SvelteKit monorepo.

Looking at the numbers (yes, all my GitHub activity I slurp up and add
to a db, then chuck it at Claude) - 415 commits across 53
repositories. Four blog posts all centred on Claude Code skills.
Sometimes you find a topic that needs documenting because nobody else
has, and this was one of those months.

## Highlights

So, the standout work this month fell into two distinct categories:
figuring out Claude Code skills for my own projects, and delivering
performance optimisations for client work that genuinely moved the
needle on load times and bundle sizes.

## Claude Skills Activation

Right, so, Claude Code skills are powerful in theory - you write
structured documentation and Claude should use it when relevant. In
practice? I was getting about 50% success rates on skill activation. A
coin toss! 😂

I worked out that you could use a `UserPromptSubmit` hook to either
call a script or directly add to the prompt, this was like a "please
sir consider running a skill if you have one" which was better than
never activation the skills. Then there's using keywords in the user
prompt but I found this brittle.
[Claude Code Skills Don't Auto-Activate (a workaround)](https://scottspence.com/posts/claude-code-skills-dont-auto-activate)

So I dug deeper. The follow up to that was
[How to Make Claude Code Skills Activate Reliably](https://scottspence.com/posts/how-to-make-claude-code-skills-activate-reliably),
where I made a test harness and run evaluations through the Claude
Agent SDK to see what worked and what didn't.

## Claude Skills CLI

Did some more work on the
[claude-skills-cli](https://github.com/spences10/claude-skills-cli) as
I'm using it for client work, it went through some iterations. Added
`--lenient` and `--loose` flags letting Claude write more (I'm keeping
the defaults for my work), a `doctor` command to fix multi-line
description issues, and multiple hook type options.

## Client Infrastructure and Performance Work

For client work I'll be giving you a peek behind the curtain on this
as I'll be doing a talk at
[JSMonthly in December](https://guild.host/events/jsmonthly-x-svelte-community-a7ui0j)
on "how I refactored 370 files in 11 hours!" Using Claude Code! The
work was spread over 11 days with some long needed refactoring and
optimisation work on the main product. Essentially I cleared up a lot
of Svelte 4 code, improved the state story on a _really_ large
component and sped up load times across the critical routes using
SvelteKit remote functions and reducing over-fetching data and db
round trips.

There was also Terraform work for AWS infrastructure - ElastiCache
migration, security group configurations, and KMS key management
amongst other things.

## Svelte Claude Skills Evaluation Framework

I built
[svelte-claude-skills](https://github.com/spences10/svelte-claude-skills)
as both a reference implementation and testing ground. It's got an
evaluation framework with activation tests, quality tests, cost
tracking, and metrics collection. The idea is to systematically test
whether skills activate when they should and produce accurate
guidance. Early days, but it's helping identify which hook
configurations work reliably.

## Blog Posts

Already detailed! But here's some more detail!

**[Claude Code Skills Not Recognised? Here's the Fix!](https://scottspence.com/posts/claude-code-skills-not-recognised)**

- When skills aren't showing up at all, it's usually YAML formatting.
  Multi-line descriptions, wrong indentation, missing required fields.

**[Claude Code Skills Don't Auto-Activate (a workaround)](https://scottspence.com/posts/claude-code-skills-dont-auto-activate)**

- This was a brittle workaround if you were relying on keywords for
  the skills. I did find that `UserPromptSubmit` calling a script was
  a good way to force activation though.

**[How to Make Claude Code Skills Activate Reliably](https://scottspence.com/posts/how-to-make-claude-code-skills-activate-reliably)**

- The real solution. Covers hook configuration, forced evaluation, and
  the testing framework I built to verify activation rates. This has
  had 14k views since I published it on the 16th - clearly a pain
  point for many!

**[Working with Claude Code! The Honest Version](https://scottspence.com/posts/working-with-claude-code-the-honest-version)**

- A broader reflection on using AI coding assistants over two years on
  a large projects. What works, what doesn't, and why the "just use
  AI" advice misses the nuance of real-world development.

## Open Source

Beyond the Claude skills work, the MCP servers and other projects got
maintenance attention this month.

**MCP Server Updates** -
[mcp-omnisearch](https://github.com/spences10/mcp-omnisearch) saw
refactoring to consolidate URL validation across providers and
standardise error handling. Fixed an issue with the `site:` operator
in Brave and Kagi queries - turns out parentheses were breaking the
search syntax.

**Sveltest Restructuring** -
[Sveltest](https://github.com/spences10/sveltest) moved to a monorepo
so that I could add a CLI for use by LLMs, yeah, not an MCP!

**Devhub CRM Documentation** - Added comprehensive migration patterns
and troubleshooting documentation for SQLite, plus cleaned up the
Claude skills for daisyUI v5 forms and SvelteKit remote functions.
Good reference material for future projects.
