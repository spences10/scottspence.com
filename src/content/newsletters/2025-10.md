## Automation Takes Flight

October was all about streamlining workflows and making things faster. After months of manually cobbling together newsletter updates, I finally carved out time to build proper automation for these monthly dispatches. You're reading the first output from that system right now.

## Highlights

**Newsletter Automation Goes Live**  
The big win this month was shipping a proper newsletter generation workflow. No more copying and pasting from various sources or trying to remember what I worked on three weeks ago. The new system pulls from my actual activity across platforms and helps craft these updates. It's already saving me hours each month, and more importantly, means you'll actually get regular updates instead of the sporadic "oh right, I should send something" emails.

**Performance Gains That Matter**  
I spent a morning diving into database query optimisation and walked away with a 60% speed improvement. Nothing flashy – just good old-fashioned query analysis and index tuning. These are the kinds of incremental improvements that compound over time and make everything feel snappier.

## Technical Deep Dives

The newsletter automation deserves a proper write-up (coming soon), but the short version is: it's a workflow that aggregates my activity from Bluesky and GitHub, processes it through a content pipeline, and generates a draft. The interesting bit was building context-aware filtering – not everything needs to make it into these updates, and teaching the system what's signal versus noise took some iteration.

The database optimisation work reminded me why performance profiling is so valuable. What looked like a harmless query was actually doing full table scans on every request. A couple of well-placed indexes later and the difference is night and day.

## Open Source

Released version 1.2.0 of `some-package` this month with several new features. The community response has been solid, and I'm already getting useful feedback for the next iteration.

Also pushed updates to scottspence.com, primarily focused on the newsletter generation infrastructure. The site continues to be my testing ground for new ideas before they make their way into other projects.

## What's Coming

November will be about expanding the automation system to handle more content sources and improving the draft generation. I'm also planning to document the entire newsletter workflow – both for my future self and anyone else tired of manual newsletter creation.

## Until Next Month

That's October wrapped. The automation is working, the code is running faster, and I'm excited about what we can build when the tedious bits handle themselves.

Keep shipping,
