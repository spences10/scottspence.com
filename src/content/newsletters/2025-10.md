## October in Review

October was all about automation and optimisation. After months of thinking about how to make these newsletters less of a chore to put together, I finally built the system to do it. Plus, some solid performance wins on the backend that'll make everything feel snappier.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation is Live

The big one this month: I shipped the newsletter automation system. This has been on my mental backlog for ages – the idea of manually collating posts, sorting through GitHub activity, and stitching it all together into something readable just felt backwards. Now it's happening automatically, which means I can actually be consistent about getting these out monthly rather than letting them slip.

The workflow pulls from Bluesky and GitHub, filters out the noise, and generates the initial draft. Turns out the hard part isn't the automation – it's deciding what's actually worth talking about versus just noise.

### Database Query Optimisation

Spent a morning diving into some sluggish queries and managed to cut response times by 60%. These aren't the flashy features that make it into release notes, but they're the kind of wins that compound. Faster queries mean better user experience across the board, less load on the database, less infrastructure cost. Small wins absolutely do add up.

## Recent Releases

**some-package v1.2.0** landed this month with some new features. Still iterating on what goes into the public packages versus what stays internal.

## Looking Ahead

Now that the newsletter system is sorted, I'm hoping to use it properly – actually maintaining a rhythm rather than scrambling every few months. Also keen to dig deeper into some of the database work that came up; there's more optimisation potential there if I dig into query patterns more systematically.

Cheers,
