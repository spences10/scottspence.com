## Automation and Optimisation

October has been about making things work better, faster, and more reliably. From finally automating these newsletters (yes, you're reading the fruits of that labour) to squeezing performance gains out of existing systems.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation Goes Live

After months of manually cobbling together updates, I've finally built a proper automation system for these newsletters. The workflow pulls together my activity across platforms, generates a draft, and gets it ready for sending. No more forgetting to send updates or scrambling at month-end to remember what I shipped.

The implementation lives in the [scottspence.com repo](https://github.com/spences10/scottspence.com) and uses a combination of API integrations and some clever markdown generation. The best part? You're reading the output right now.

### Database Performance Wins

Sometimes the best features are the ones users never see. Spent a morning diving into query optimisation and managed to achieve a **60% performance improvement** on some critical database operations. These weren't complex refactors – just careful analysis of query patterns and adding the right indices in the right places.

It's a reminder that performance work doesn't always need to be a massive undertaking. Small, targeted improvements compound over time.

## Open Source

Released **some-package v1.2.0** this month with several new features that users have been requesting. The package continues to grow steadily, and it's satisfying to see it solving real problems for people.

## Technical Deep Dives

The newsletter automation system deserves a proper write-up. It's a interesting mix of:
- API integrations for gathering activity data
- Content generation with structured prompts
- GitHub Actions for scheduling and deployment
- Markdown processing for the final output

I'll be documenting the full architecture in a blog post soon – there are some patterns here that could be useful for anyone looking to automate their content workflows.

## What's Coming

November is looking busy already. Planning to expand the newsletter automation to handle more data sources and potentially add some analytics to track what content resonates. Also eyeing some improvements to the site's build times – if the database optimisation taught me anything, it's that there are always performance gains hiding in plain sight.

## Until Next Month

Thanks for reading! These newsletters are now automated but still crafted with care. Let me know what you'd like to see more (or less) of.
