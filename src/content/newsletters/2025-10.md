## October 2025

Well, October's been about getting things automated. I've been tinkering with systems to make life easier when it comes time to ship these newsletters, and I'm pleased to say it's actually working now.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation is Live

After weeks of tinkering, I finally shipped the newsletter generation workflow. This isn't just about sending emails—it's a proper system that pulls together posts, activity, and context into something readable. The infrastructure is in place now, so future months should be considerably less manual. I pushed the implementation to `scottspence.com` with the full feature set, and it's handling the heavy lifting as intended.

### Performance Wins

Spent a morning digging into database queries and managed to squeeze out a 60% performance improvement. These sorts of optimisations don't always feel flashy, but they compound. Faster queries mean better experience across the board, and when you're hitting the database frequently, that matters.

## What's Next

November should see me focusing on polishing some edges around the automation system—there's always something to refine once the core is working. I'm also eyeing some improvements to the query optimisation work; there's likely more efficiency to find if I keep digging.

Until next month.
