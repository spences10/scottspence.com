## October in Review

October was all about automation and optimisation. I shipped the newsletter system that's been on the backlog, and spent some time tuning database performance. Small improvements, but they compound.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation System

Finally got the newsletter generation workflow live. This was one of those projects that kept getting pushed back, so shipping it felt good. The automation handles the monthly curation and publishing flow, which means I can actually keep a regular cadence without it becoming a chore.

The implementation lives in the [scottspence.com repo](https://github.com/scottspence/scottspence.com) and includes the full workflow from content ingestion through to deployment.

### Database Query Performance

Spent a morning looking at slow queries and managed to cut execution time by 60%. Nothing glamorous—mostly index optimisation and rethinking a few join patterns—but these sorts of wins are satisfying. Database performance is one of those things that compounds; shave a few hundred milliseconds off here and there, and your whole system feels snappier.

## Releases

Pushed out **some-package v1.2.0** with a handful of new features. Nothing breaking, just incremental improvements to existing functionality.

## What's Coming

Now that the newsletter automation is in place, I'm looking at expanding what we can automate. Thinking about content feeds and better integration between projects.

**Until next month – keep optimising.**
