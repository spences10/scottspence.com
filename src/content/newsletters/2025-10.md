## October Wrap-Up

October was all about automation and optimisation. I shipped the newsletter system that's now getting these monthly updates out reliably, sorted through some performance work, and released a new version of some-package with fresh features.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation System

Finally got the newsletter generation workflow live. This was a bigger project than it sounds – automating the curation, writing, and delivery means I can actually maintain this cadence without it becoming a chore. The system pulls from Bluesky posts and GitHub activity, filters for signal, and helps me write in a consistent voice. It's the kind of infrastructure investment that pays dividends over time.

### Performance Wins

Spent a morning diving into database queries and managed to shave 60% off query times with some strategic optimisation. Nothing flashy – just the usual suspects: proper indexing, query restructuring, and eliminating N+1 problems. These compound nicely though. Small wins in performance work add up fast when you're consistent about it.

### some-package 1.2.0

Released version 1.2.0 with a handful of new features. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid incremental progress on the package.

## What's Coming

November will likely focus on expanding what the newsletter automation can do – there's room to improve the curation logic and maybe add some post-generation editorial tools. Always more to optimise too.
