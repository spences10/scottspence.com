# October 2025

## Opening

October was all about finishing things. After months of planning and tinkering, I finally shipped the newsletter automation system – which means I can actually get these monthly updates out consistently. There's something satisfying about completing a project that removes friction from your own workflow.

## Highlights

### Newsletter Automation System Live

The big win this month was shipping the newsletter generation workflow. I'd been putting this off for longer than I care to admit, but it's now integrated into the site build process. This means I can focus on writing and curating content rather than fighting with manual formatting and deployment steps. It's exactly the kind of tooling that pays dividends over time.

### Database Query Optimisation

Nothing flashy, but I spent some time profiling and optimising database queries across the site. Managed to knock 60% off the response times on a few hot paths. These kinds of incremental improvements often go unnoticed, but they compound – faster queries mean better user experience and lower hosting costs.

### some-package 1.2.0 Released

Cut a new release with some fresh features. Nothing breaking, but useful additions for folks using the package. Always good to get improvements out the door rather than letting them pile up on a branch.

## What's Coming

With the newsletter automation in place, I'm keen to focus more on writing and technical exploration. There are a few interesting ideas brewing around developer tooling and workflow optimisation that I'd like to dig into properly.

## Closing

Small, deliberate wins this month. Shipping tools that reduce your own friction is underrated – it creates space for what actually matters.

Until next month,
Scott
