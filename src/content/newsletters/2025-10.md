## October Highlights

October was a productive month of shipping and optimising. The big one was finally getting the newsletter automation system live – something I've been meaning to sort out for a while now. Having a proper workflow in place should make these monthly updates much more sustainable going forward.

## Shipping the Newsletter Automation

I've been running this newsletter manually for far too long, so I decided to build a proper system to handle the heavy lifting. The new automation workflow now sits in [`scottspence.com`](https://github.com/scottspence/scottspence.com) and handles the collection, curation, and generation of monthly updates.

It's a satisfying bit of tooling – the kind of thing that feels tedious to build but pays dividends every single month afterwards. No more scrambling on the 30th trying to remember what I've worked on.

## Database Query Optimisation

Mid-month, I spent a morning profiling some database queries that had been nagging at me. Found a few N+1 queries and some inefficient lookups that were easy wins. The result: a 60% performance improvement in one of the main data fetches.

It's a good reminder that sometimes the biggest impact comes from spending focused time on bottlenecks rather than adding new features. Small wins absolutely do add up.

## Release: some-package 1.2.0

Shipped [`some-package`](https://github.com/scottspence/some-package) version 1.2.0 with a handful of new features. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid incremental progress on the tooling front.

## What's Coming

November will likely focus on improving the newsletter workflow based on actual usage, and I've got a few ideas for deeper optimisations in other parts of the stack. More to come.

Thanks for reading. See you next month.
