# Newsletters

This directory contains monthly newsletter markdown files generated by
the automated workflow.

## Format

Each file is named `YYYY-MM.md` and contains:

```markdown
---
title: 'Newsletter: Month Year'
date: YYYY-MM-DD
published: false
---

# Newsletter content here
```

## Publishing

Once you've reviewed and edited a newsletter draft:

1. Set `published: true` in the frontmatter
2. Merge the PR
3. A separate workflow will send the newsletter via Resend (when
   implemented)

## Workflow

- **Generation**: Triggered on the 1st of each month at 9am UTC (or
  manually via workflow dispatch)
- **Agent**: The `.claude/agents/newsletter-generator.md` file defines
  the curation rules
- **Script**: `scripts/generate-newsletter.js` fetches data and calls
  the Anthropic API
- **PR**: Automatically creates a PR with the draft for review

See `.github/workflows/generate-newsletter-draft.yml` for workflow
configuration.
