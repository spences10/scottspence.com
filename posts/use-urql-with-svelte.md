**This guide has now been updated, take a look at [Use URQL with
SvelteKit] for an up to date reference**

Use the Universal React Query Library (URQL) in Svelte!

Yeah, React and Svelte! Well, not really! There are [Svelte
bindings in URQL] now! So I'm going to take a look at configuring it for
use in a Svelte project. If you're wondering if URQL is right for your
project you can check out the [features by comparison].

So, standard guide fodder now, spin up a new project and configure the
thing.

## GraphQL endpoint

<!-- cSpell:ignore probs -->

So what I'm going to need is a GraphQL endpoint to query, no probs,
I'll spin up a GraphCMS project blog template and use the Content API
from that for my endpoint.

Check out the short explainer video if none of that made any sense to
you:

## Set up the project

Time to spin up a new project, I can do that using the `npm init`
command:

```bash
npm init svelte@next sveltekit-with-urql
```

From the CLI prompts I'll pick the following options:

```bash
âœ” Skeleton project
âœ” Use TypeScript? â€º No
âœ” Add ESLint for code linting? â€º No
âœ” Add Prettier for code formatting? â€º Yes
```

Once that's finished doing it's thing I can change into the newly
created project (`cd`) directory and install the dependencies along
with the dependencies I'll need for URQL:

```bash
# change into newly created project directory
cd sveltekit-with-urql
# install dependencies
npm i
# install dependencies for URQL
npm i -D @urql/svelte graphql
```

Now I can start the dev server and start making the changes to use
URQL.

## URQL client

As URQL is used client side (in the browser after the page has loaded)
there's no need to use `<script context="module">` which was what
initially confused me when starting out with it!

For the URQL client I'll need to create it in a place accessible by
other pages so the most logical place (to me) is to use the client in
a Svelte layout page, I'll need to create that:

```bash
touch src/routes/'__layout.svelte'
```

I'll add in the URQL `initClient` and pass in the endpoint, you can
use a `.env` file here, if you do make sure to add `.env` to your
`.gitignore` file:

```bash
touch .env
echo .env >> .gitignore
```

As it's a publicly accessible endpoint I'm not going to be too
concerned about exposing it publicly with the `VITE_` variable you can
read up on hiding [env secrets] with SvelteKit for more information.

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/__layout.svelte -->
<script>
	import { initClient } from '@urql/svelte'
	initClient({
		url: import.meta.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_URL,
	})
</script>

<main>
	<slot />
</main>

<style>
	main {
		position: relative;
		max-width: 640px;
		margin: 0 auto;
		padding: 0 20px;
	}
</style>
```

## Using the URQL client

Now I can use the client in the index page of the project to display
the results from a query, for now I'll just query for the `posts`,
`title` and `slug`, I'll define the query in a `qgl` tag as
`postsQuery` and pass that to the URQL `operationStore` then use the
URQL `query` to create a subscription for `posts`:

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/index.svelte -->
<script>
	// urql initialization
	import { gql, operationStore, query } from '@urql/svelte'
	const postsQuery = gql`
		query Posts {
			posts {
				title
				slug
			}
		}
	`
	// request policy is cache-first (default)
	const posts = operationStore(postsQuery)
	query(posts)
</script>
```

The subscription means I can use the `$` sign in front of the `posts`
variable to subscribe to changes.

I'll use some conditional rendering with Svelte to check if the posts
are fetching or if there are any errors before using the Svelte each
directive to loop through the results of the data from endpoint:

<!-- cSpell:ignore oopsie -->

```svelte
{#if $posts.fetching}
	<p>Loading...</p>
{:else if $posts.error}
	<p>Oopsie! {$posts.error.message}</p>
{:else}
	<ul>
		{#each $posts.data.posts as post}
			<li>
				<a href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
					<p>{post.title}</p>
				</a>
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
{/if}
```

Here's the full `src/routes/index.svelte` file:

```svelte
<script>
	// urql initialization
	import { gql, operationStore, query } from '@urql/svelte'
	const postsQuery = gql`
		query Posts {
			posts {
				title
				slug
			}
		}
	`
	// request policy is cache-first (default)
	const posts = operationStore(postsQuery)
	query(posts)
</script>

{#if $posts.fetching}
	<p>Loading...</p>
{:else if $posts.error}
	<p>Oopsie! {$posts.error.message}</p>
{:else}
	<ul>
		{#each $posts.data.posts as post}
			<li>
				<a href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
					<p>{post.title}</p>
				</a>
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
{/if}

<style>
	li {
		list-style: none;
		margin-bottom: 5rem;
	}
</style>
```

Running the dev server will now give me an unordered list with the
post title and a link to the `posts` route for that slug! That doesn't
exist yet, so if you're interested in going through that then I'll add
more to that in [Building on the example].

## Conclusion

I now have URQL configured for use in a SvelteKit project ðŸŽ‰

This pattern can be used for querying any GraphQL endpoint and
displaying the results on the client (the browser).

## Building on the example

So I have an index page showing me the results for a query but not
much else, so now I can add to the example I currently have to use
SvelteKit routing to display the data for a single post.

As I'm using a predefined template from GraphCMS I'm going to pop on
over to the GraphCMS playground and define a query for a single post,
this will look a little something like this:

```graphql
query Post($slug: String!) {
	post(where: { slug: $slug }) {
		title
		date
		tags
		content {
			html
		}
	}
}
```

I can now use that in the `posts` route to query for the post relating
to the `$slug` variable being passed into the query.

I'll need to create the `posts` folder and the `[slug].svelte` file:

```bash
# make the posts folder
mkdir -p src/routes/posts
# make the [slug].svelte file
touch src/routes/posts/'[slug]'.svelte
```

To get the slug needed for the GraphQL query I'll need to get that
from the page params using the SvelteKit script context module load
function:

```svelte
<script context="module">
	export const load = async ({ page: { params } }) => {
		const { slug } = params
		return { props: { slug } }
	}
</script>
```

The `<script context="module">` is run before the pae loads and the
`load` function is destructuring out the `params` parameter, then
there's a further destructuring of the `slug` from that, the `slug`
can now be passed to the page as `props`.

Then I can instantiate a new `operationStore` in the `[slug].svelte`
file passing in that query:

```svelte
<script>
	export let slug
	import { gql, operationStore, query } from '@urql/svelte'
	const productQuery = gql`
		query Post($slug: String!) {
			post(where: { slug: $slug }) {
				title
				date
				tags
				content {
					html
				}
			}
		}
	`
	const post = operationStore(productQuery, { slug })
	query(post)
</script>
```

The page slug is passed into the `operationStore` for the GraphQL
variable that is used in the `Post` query (`Post($slug:`).

I can then subscribe to the changes with `$post`, for the sake of
brevity I'm going to use a `pre` tag and stringify the results:

```html
<pre>{JSON.stringify($post, null, 2)}</pre>
```

Here's the full file:

```svelte
<script context="module">
	export const load = async ({ page: { params } }) => {
		const { slug } = params
		return { props: { slug } }
	}
</script>

<script>
	export let slug
	import { gql, operationStore, query } from '@urql/svelte'
	const productQuery = gql`
		query Post($slug: String!) {
			post(where: { slug: $slug }) {
				title
				date
				tags
				content {
					html
				}
			}
		}
	`
	const post = operationStore(productQuery, { slug })
	query(post)
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify($post, null, 2)}</pre>
```

That's it, the rest of this can be built on for rendering out the post
markup the same way as in the index file.
