  let href = `/posts/sveltekit-environment-variables-with-the-sveltekit-env-module`
  const options = {
    type: 'warning',
    message: `SvelteKit now handles env secrets, take a look at <a

  }
</script>

I've been having a play around with Storyblok this evening and want to
make some notes on getting set up with it.

With the moving target that is the public beta of SvelteKit there's a
few things that have changed recently which I want to document here.

If you've not used [Svelte] or [SvelteKit] before you can check out
the awesome tutorial for Svelte over on [svelte.dev/tutorial] it's got
everything you need. There's also [learn.svelte.dev] for SvelteKit
which is under development at the time of writing.

If you want to follow along, minimum requirements will be a computer
development setup with Node version 16+ installed and a text editor,
I'll be using VS Code.

## Setup the SvelteKit project

I'll get the SvelteKit project set up first with a few commands:

```bash
npm init svelte storyblok-and-sveltekit
cd storyblok-and-sveltekit
```

I'll be using `pnpm` for installing dependencies, if you prefer `npm`
or `yarn` you can use those instead. Just be aware if you're copy
pasting terminal commands you'll need to change that.

I'll be picking the following options from the SvelteKit CLI:

```bash
? Which Svelte app template? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    SvelteKit demo app
‚ùØ   Skeleton project - Barebones scaffolding for your new SvelteKit app
? Add type checking with TypeScript? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Yes, using JavaScript with JSDoc comments
‚ùØ   Yes, using TypeScript syntax
    No
‚úî Add ESLint for code linting? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Add Prettier for code formatting? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Add Playwright for browser testing? ‚Ä¶ Yes
```

These are the options I usually always pick when creating any new
SvelteKit project. What I've picked will not impact the rest of this
guide, especially `ESLint`, `Prettier` and `Playwright`.

If you decide you want to go without `TypeScript` support then remove
the `lang="ts"` from the `<script>` tag in the coming examples.

If you decide to go with JavaScript with JSDoc comments then you'll
still need to annotate for types.

I'll install dependencies then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Going to `http://localhost:5173` will display the SvelteKit skeleton
project.

## Setup Tailwind

Just before I go onto the Storyblok configuration, I'll want to get
some nice default styles into the project with Tailwind CSS. This is a
one liner setup with the awesome [Svelte Add] project:

```bash
## --typography adds the Tailwind typography plugin
npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss --typography
```

The script will configure Tailwind for use in the project and add in
the typography plugin to the `tailwind.config.cjs` file.

All that's needed to do after that is install the dependencies with
`pnpm i`.

## Get Storyblok setup

If you're following along and you've not got a Storyblok account
already then you'll need to [sign up for one], otherwise sign in.

From here, I'm greeted with a welcome screen and a button to 'Create a
new space'.

Clicking that I'll be taken to the 'Create a new space' page with
several options, the default 'Create new space' is good enough for
this guide. I'll give it a name (I'm calling mine 'SvelteKit example'
very imaginative, I know üòä) then I'll click the 'Create space'
button.

[![storyblok-create-new-space]] [storyblok-create-new-space]

I'm then taken to the 'Content' section (in the left hand sidebar),
from here there's a list of content, as it was a new space (start from
scratch) there's only a home page content type shown in the main
screen.

You'll also notice in the sidebar toward the bottom there's a 'Switch
to V2' button.

[![storyblok-switch-to-v2-sidebar]] [storyblok-switch-to-v2-sidebar]

I'll be using the V2 version so clicking on that will change the
screen and take me to the 'Dashboard' in the sidebar, I can then
select 'Content' from the sidebar. On the main page I'll select the
'Home' page content type.

That takes me to the visual editor displaying **‚ú® Welcome to the
Visual Editor ‚ú®** from this welcome section I can copy the 'Access
token' needed for accessing the Storyblok API.

[![storyblok-welcome-to-the-visual-editor]]
[storyblok-welcome-to-the-visual-editor]

There's also a 'Set up preview url' section with an input field for
the URL of my local dev server.

I'll add in the suggested URL from the placeholder in the input field:

```bash
https://localhost:3000/
```

Yes! That is **`https`**!

Before clicking 'Save and show' I'll need to get my SvelteKit project
set up to enable the visual editor.

## SvelteKit and Vite HTTPS server setup

Storyblok needs to run from a HTTPS server, so unlike normal local
development (on HTTP) I'll need to create a local `HTTPS` server. To
do that I'll install the `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` Vite plugin and
configure it. First up install the Vite plugin:

```bash
pnpm i -D @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl
```

This is also a good time to set the server port as Vite will use the
default port (5173) otherwise.

In the `vite.config.js` file I'll add the following:

```js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import basicSsl from '@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl'

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
	plugins: [sveltekit(), basicSsl()],
	server: {
		port: 3000,
		https: true,
	},
}

export default config
```

I can start the dev server now (`pnpm run dev`) and the terminal
output will show the `HTTPS` server running.

Going to `https://localhost:3000/` on Edge I get a warning.

<!-- cSpell:ignore isnt -->

[![storyblok-your-connection-isnt-private]]
[storyblok-your-connection-isnt-private]

From here I can click on the 'Advanced' button and select the
'Continue to localhost (unsafe)' link.

[![storyblok-your-connection-isnt-private-advanced]]
[storyblok-your-connection-isnt-private-advanced]

Now I have access to `https://localhost:3000/` with a persistent
warning from Edge to show that I'm using a connection without a
certificate (~~`https`~~).

[![storyblok-not-secure]] [storyblok-not-secure]

Over to the visual editor page on Storyblok I can click on the 'Save
and show' button now.

The live preview will update showing a `404` page on here I need to
click on the sliders for 'Entry configuration' in the header and set
the 'Real path' as `/`.

[![storyblok-set-visual-editor-real-path]]
[storyblok-set-visual-editor-real-path]

Clicking 'Save & Close' will now show the SvelteKit skeleton project!

[![storyblok-connect-to-local-host-success]]
[storyblok-connect-to-local-host-success]

Now I can configure Storyblok to work with my local dev server and my
Storyblok project to show the page content type with it's nested types
on there.

## Storyblok bridge with Svelte

If you've not used Storyblok before, this is where the magic happens.
The Svelte Storyblok SDK (amongst other things) allows the live
preview and editing of the components in Storyblok to be reflected on
the project running on `localhost`.

Install the [`@storyblok/svelte`] package and the Storyblok peer
dependency for `axios`, at the time of writing this was how I resolved
this. There's a mention of adding `axios` to `optimiseDeps` in the
[Add a Headless CMS to Svelte in 5 minutes] guide but adding that to
the `vite.config.js` file caused the same errors.

```bash
pnpm i -D @storyblok/svelte axios
```

## Create SvelteKit files for use with Storyblok

I'll create the files I'm going to need to get the connection between
the local SvelteKit project and the Storyblok project set up.

Svelte Add already took care of creating the SvelteKit
`__layout.svelte` file for me, so I'll create some components to
represent the various content types in Storyblok. I'll need to create
the following files:

- Content type: page
- Nested (Block): grid, feature, teaser

I'll use the terminal to create the files and folders (directories)
needed:

```bash
# create lib and components folders in src
mkdir -p src/lib/components
# Create the component files needed
touch src/lib/components/{feature.svelte,grid.svelte,page.svelte,teaser.svelte}
```

## Environment variables

<Banner {options}/>

As I'll want to be committing this to source control I don't really
want to add my access tokens. I can use the Vite way which is to add:

```js
import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME
```

To the Svelte file and add the tokens to a `.env` file to access them,
however, Vite will expose these on the client (the browser).

To keep them away from prying eyes I can use `env-cmd` which will
allow me to access the environment variables without Vite.

I'll install the `env-cmd` package for use shortly:

```bash
pnpm i -D env-cmd
```

I did a post a while back on [SvelteKit .env secrets] if you want to
give that a read!

I'll create a `.env` file in the root of the project and a
`env-vars.ts` file in the `src/lib` folder.

```bash
touch .env
touch src/lib/env-vars.ts
```

In the `.env` file I can define however many environment variables I
need for use locally. I've put an example for one for using draft and
published tokens where the stage is published which is commented out:

```bash
# draft
STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=my-local-access-token
STORYBLOK_STAGE=draft
# published
# STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=my-production-access-token
# STORYBLOK_STAGE=published
```

I can create additional tokens in the 'Settings' > 'Access tokens'
section on Storyblok.

[![storyblok-settings-access-tokens]]
[storyblok-settings-access-tokens]

Within the `env-vars.ts` file I can export the variables needed for
the access token (`STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`) and the stage
(`STORYBLOK_STAGE`):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
export const STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN = process.env['STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN']
export const STORYBLOK_STAGE = process.env['STORYBLOK_STAGE']
```

I will now be able to import these in the currently empty SvelteKit
files.

Last thing to do here is to add `env-cmd` to the `package.json`
scripts so it runs on the `dev` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "env-cmd vite dev",
  // rest of the scripts
```

If I wanted to create builds locally I'd also need to create a
`build:local` script which uses `env-cmd` too:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "env-cmd vite dev",
  "build": "vite build",
  "build:local": "env-cmd vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  // rest of the scripts
```

## SvelteKit layout file

A [layout file in SvelteKit] is a way to persist elements across route
changes, like a navbar and footer. This is also the place to initialise
Storyblok for use across the project.

To load data before the page loads I'll use the
`<script context="module">` script tags to initialise the Storyblok
client.

I'll add in the access token for the Storyblok project here and import
the components needed for use in the `storyblokInit` function from the
`lib` folder.

```svelte
<script context="module">
	import Feature from '$lib/components/feature.svelte'
	import Grid from '$lib/components/grid.svelte'
	import Page from '$lib/components/page.svelte'
	import Teaser from '$lib/components/teaser.svelte'
	import { STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN } from '$lib/env-vars'
	import { apiPlugin, storyblokInit } from '@storyblok/svelte'
	import '../app.css'

	storyblokInit({
		accessToken: STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN,
		use: [apiPlugin],
		components: {
			feature: Feature,
			grid: Grid,
			page: Page,
			teaser: Teaser,
		},
	})
</script>

<main class="prose prose-xl">
	<slot />
</main>
```

## Component files

Now I can get to adding code to the component files. Credit to
Josefine Schaefer and her [example code on GitHub].

<!-- cSpell:ignore blok -->

The page component (`page.svelte`) is a [root block] content type and uses
a Svelte action in `storyblokEditable` to use the prop being passed to
it (`export let blok`).

Using a Svelte each expression I can loop through the `blok.body` and
pass the `blok` to the `StoryblokComponent` as props.

I'm using the TypeScript `any` type because I was having issues using
the `StoryData` type.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import {
		StoryblokComponent,
		storyblokEditable,
	} from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export let blok: any
</script>

<div use:storyblokEditable={blok} class="px-6">
	{#each blok.body as blok}
		<StoryblokComponent {blok} />
	{/each}
</div>
```

For the `grid.svelte` component, a similar story to the page component
except I'm checking for a columns property and looping over that.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import {
		StoryblokComponent,
		storyblokEditable,
	} from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export let blok: any
</script>

<div use:storyblokEditable={blok} class="mb-6 flex py-8">
	{#each blok.columns as blok}
		<div class="flex-auto px-6">
			<StoryblokComponent {blok} />
		</div>
	{/each}
</div>
```

The `feature.svelte` file is nested in the grid component!

Let me break down my understanding of it, the `blok` prop being passed
to the `StoryblokComponent` in `grid.svelte` is the prop being passed
into this file (`feature.svelte`).

If I dump out the data being passed into the grid component, I get
this:

```js
columns: [
	{
		_uid: 'eb32fb87-721d-4834-8523-73ea81cbb6f7',
		name: 'Feature 1',
		component: 'feature',
		_editable: '<!--#storyblok#{"name": "feature"} -->',
	},
]
```

Then the data being passed to the feature component looks like this:

```js
{
  _uid: 'eb32fb87-721d-4834-8523-73ea81cbb6f7',
  name: 'Feature 1',
  component: 'feature',
  _editable: '<!--#storyblok#{"name": "feature"} -->',
}
```

It's the same data, with the individual `columns` being rendered out
by `feature.svelte` as a child (or nested) component.

I'll use the `storyblokEditable` action in the `feature.svelte`
component passing in the `blok` prop and render out a div with the
`blok.name` for the content.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { storyblokEditable } from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export let blok: any
</script>

<div use:storyblokEditable={blok} class="py-2">
	<div class="text-lg">{blok.name}</div>
</div>
```

For `teaser.svelte` I'm going to use the same pattern as
`feature.svelte`, but as I want to use it as the page heading, I'll
wrap the `blok.name` in a `h1` tag.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { storyblokEditable } from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export let blok: any
</script>

<div use:storyblokEditable={blok}>
	{blok.headline}
</div>
```

## Svelte index (home) page

I've got all the components I need now for use in `storyblokInit`.

In the index page I'll want to get the Storyblok `home` data for use
in the page. Much like with the layout file I'll want to get this data
before the page loads so I'll need a `<script context="module">` block
to call the results from the `useStoryblokApi` in a SvelteKit load
function.

I'll destructure the `story` out of the response from the API call and
return that as props for the page to use.

With Svelte `onMount`, this is called once the page has loaded, this
is when the `useStoryblokBridge` is called passing in the `story` prop
from the context module.

<Details buttonText="Click to expand">

```svelte
<script context="module">
	import { STORYBLOK_STAGE } from '$lib/env-vars'
	import { useStoryblokApi } from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export const load = async () => {
		const storyblokApi = useStoryblokApi()
		const {
			data: { story },
		} = await storyblokApi.get('cdn/stories/home', {
			version: STORYBLOK_STAGE,
		})
		return {
			props: { story },
		}
	}
</script>

<script lang="ts">
	import {
		StoryblokComponent,
		useStoryblokBridge,
	} from '@storyblok/svelte'
	import { onMount } from 'svelte'

	export let story: any

	onMount(() => {
		useStoryblokBridge(story.id, newStory => (story = newStory))
	})
</script>

<div>
	{#if story}
		<StoryblokComponent blok={story.content} />
	{/if}
</div>
```

</Details>

## Add additional field to Feature block

Let's say now, if I wanted to add a bit more content to the feature
component, like some body content explaining the feature. I'll expand
on that a little now.

What I'll do to finish up here is add a new field to the feature
block, I can get to my block library from navigating back from the
visual editor page and select the 'Block Library' from the sidebar.

I can hover over the 'feature' block and click the ellipsis (`...`)
and select 'Edit'.

[![storyblok-edit-block-schema-menu]]
[storyblok-edit-block-schema-menu]

This brings up a context menu where I can edit the feature block and
add additional fields to it, I'm going to give the field a name of
body and click the 'Add' button.

[![storyblok-edit-block-schema-add-field]]
[storyblok-edit-block-schema-add-field]

The newly created field will now show up in the list under the 'name'
field.

[![storyblok-edit-block-schema-field-added]]
[storyblok-edit-block-schema-field-added]

Clicking on that will take me to the edit field options where I can
select the field type. I'm going to keep it as a text field, I could
go into using the [Storyblok `RichTextResolver`] but I think I'll leave
that for another post.

[![storyblok-edit-block-schema-edit-field]]
[storyblok-edit-block-schema-edit-field]

Now, if I go back to the 'Content' section in the sidebar and select
the 'Home' story, I can select the 'Grid' then 'Feature' I can see
there's a new 'Body' field I can start adding content to.

I'll add in content to the three fields and save the content for each
block as I go along.

To display the feature body content I'll make a little adjustment to
the `feature.svelte` file to include the `blok.body` content.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { storyblokEditable } from '@storyblok/svelte'

	export let blok: any
</script>

<div use:storyblokEditable={blok} class="py-2">
	<div class="text-lg">{blok.name}</div>
	<div class="text-lg">{blok.body}</div>
</div>
```

## Conclusion

There you have it! I've gone from scratch to a basic SvelteKit project
to consume a Storyblok API.

I hope you found it useful and that you have everything you need to
get started with Storyblok and SvelteKit.

I've only really scratched the surface of Storyblok here using the
default story generated when creating a new space, but I've learned a
_lot_ in the process documenting this.
