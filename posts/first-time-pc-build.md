I built my first PC, here's how it went and what I learned.

Up until recently I was very happy with my home computer, which was an
[ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA].

That was until the CPU fan started grinding against the internals,
this caused the CPU to heat up more making the fan spin faster to try
cool it causing an even louder grinding noise.

## Why get a PC?

The situation with my ASUS Transformer sort of forced the issue this
time but I have historically gone with a laptop, before the
Transformer I had another ASUS laptop with an i5 processor and 8GB of
RAM which was lasted me from ~2013-2016.

I'd been looking at building my own PC for some time, I have a Google
Sheets, sheet which shows as last edited May 4th 2013 ðŸ˜®

For me there's always been the unknown of whether the parts will fit
together as you're spending a fair bit of money on what feels like a
gamble.

There's also the portability argument, as you can't really take it
with you easily, the reality was for me however that both prior
machines never left the house as they were plugged into a monitor
keyboard an mouse all the time.

## Replacement parts

Regarding the fan on the Transformer, it's a sealed unit making a part
replacement something I'd either have to get specialist tools for or
send it off somewhere to be serviced.

After watching YouTube tear down videos I decided against attempting a
repair myself.

The first half of the video is getting the adhesive loose with a heat
gun, the rest was trying to remove screws and clips with one hand
whilst holding the screen that is connected main unit with the other
hand.

<YouTube youTubeId="EIoBRYh0Ukk" />

> I decided that I didn't want to be in this position again.

## What do you want to do with it?

The first question a lot of seasoned PC builders will ask in response
to you saying you want to build a PC is "what do you want to do with
it?"

For me it's mainly code, some streaming and video editing. That helps
determine the hardware you'll need.

Massive thanks to my Twitter friend [James McAllister] for helping me fine
tune my final selection of parts.

## What type of aesthetic do you want?

I have no room to spare for a large tower PC so I decided to go with a
Mini ITX compatible case.

The case you choose will be a determining factor in the parts you can
have in there.

## PC Part Picker

Enter [PC Part Picker] this site is a MASSIVE help when it comes to
picking compatible parts for your PC build.

This was my guide when I came to picking parts and building my system.
There are _loads_ of [completed builds] where enthusiasts and beginners
just like myself would post their completed builds and corresponding parts
list on PC Part Picker.

If there is a specific system you have in mind chances are someone has
already built it and posted their completed build here.

Here's a couple of Intel builds I'd put together a few years ago
without putting a great deal or research into the parts I was going to
use. They centred around an i3 with differing [motherboards] and
[GPUs], see the compatibility warnings on them.

## Decide on what to get

So, I had a shopping list of things I needed to get.

From the _many_ YouTube videos I watched there are seven essential
items needed to build a PC, these are:

- CPU
- CPU cooler
- Motherboard
- Memory (RAM)
- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Storage (onboard memory for OS)
- Case
- Power supply (PSU)

I wanted something a bit more powerful than the Inter Core i7 (two
cores, four threads) that was in the ASUS Transformer, with a bump to
the 16GB of RAM it had.

From watching YouTube a _lot_ I found that AMD was leading the way in
CPU performance per Â£ and the Ryzen chips where where it's at right
now.

The **CPU** I chose was the [Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 GHz AF] the AF although is
not officially listed (you have to look for "bb af box" in the listing)
this means that it's the previous generation of one of the higher end chips
in the range.

The CPU is a healthy 6 cores (12 threads) quite a bump from the last
one!

The Ryzen 5 also comes with a CPU **fan included**, so saving a bit of
money there.

<!-- cSpell:ignore strix,nvme,HTPC -->

For the **Motherboard** I went with whatever I could get that would
offered some expansion to the memory further down the line so I went
with the [Asus ROG Strix B450-I Gaming] motherboard which has a memory
max of 64GB.

Speaking of **memory** I went with some [Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB
(2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory] which is double the 16GB I had prior.

The video card **(GPU)** was a [XFX Radeon RX 570 8 GB Video Card] which
[benchmarked well against a GTX 960] and was reasonably priced.

For the **storage** I went with a [Samsung 970 Evo 500 GB
M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive], Samsung is renowned for their memory
and this drive (M.2) screws directly to the motherboard, which has two
M.2 slots available.

The **case**, although toward the end of the list here was really what
dictated the parts I could use. The standout case for me was the
[Fractal Design Node 202 HTPC Case w/450 W Power Supply] this really appealed
to me due to the small form factor and the amount of people building with
it.

You can also get the Node 202 without a power supply but for the extra
Â£70 I decided to go with the 450w power supply for now.

## Watch other people build with your parts

I watched a butt load of people building PCs on YouTube, channels I'd
recommend are [Paul's Hardware], [Bitwit] and of course [Linus Tech
Tips] all with good starter guides on building PCs.

First up is a good build guide on Paul's Hardware on [How To Build
a $550 Gaming PC in 2020!] not related to the parts I wanted to use
but I did get the tip here about the AF version for the CPU.

There's also another build guide from Bitwit on [How to Build a PC!
Step-by-step], not related to the parts I wanted to use again but searching
YouTube for "[Bitwit Node 202]" shows several builds using the case I wanted
to use.

This guide really helped by pointing out that there was a video card
assembly, which you attach the video card to before inserting it into
the case.

<YouTube youTubeId="8YfdDir4Opg" />

This guide was what made me aware that I may be biting off a bit more
than I can chew saying it may be a bit of a challenge adding all the
parts to the case.

<YouTube youTubeId="OoWzSp6SS5c" />

## Get the parts

So after binging on Node 202 build guides and not being able to stand
the sound of the fan grinding to a halt one more time on my ASUS
Transformer any longer I started buying the parts for my shiny new
computer.

PC Part Picker is an awesome tool for sourcing your parts, I bought my
components from several different suppliers as pricing for parts
varied wildly, the case and motherboard I got from [SCAN] the CPU from
Amazon and the Memory, RAM and Graphics Card from [CCL].

All parts turned up the next day, which I was amazed about! I love you
DPD!

## Build the thing

So with all the information I had gleaned from the YouTube I set about
putting it together!

Unbox the case, here you can see the power supply that comes with the
case and those yummy looking "ketchup and mustard" cables!

![the empty case]

One of the first things I wanted to check before going ay further was
the clearance between the CPU fan and the case in case I needed to buy
a lower profile fan, thankfully it was clear!

![cpu fan clearance]

This is when it becomes clear that I have made my first mistake!

I started assembling the motherboard and noticed the fan was blocking
the RAM slots!

This was also by far the most uncomfortable part for me as the spring
loaded screws on the fan made it really difficult to get them to
thread into the board.

![fan covering memory slots]

Another confusing part for me was when I was trying to screw the
motherboard into the case I noticed the screws weren't really catching
the thread on the case. I looked at the case instructions and it says
there's three different types of screws. They all looked identical to
me but they were very subtly different.

![case screws]

I secure the power supply to the case, which was loosely mounted then
screw in the motherboard and notice it's a big mess of cables right
now.

![cables]

Then remove the GPU assembly and attach the riser card to that then
add the GPU to the assembly to add later.

![gpu assembly]

Add the GPU to the case, remember to take of the contact protecting
tip on the GPU card!

![case front with gpu installed]

This is what it looks like from the other side, I clearly have to do a
bit of cable management at this point.

![case back gpu installed]

I should have connected the cables for the front of the case to the
motherboard prior to installing it. These are the cables for power and
the drive indicator but I didn't so I was left trying to figure out
where they went with this much space!

![motherboard front panel headers]

All wired up and ready to close now, after some cable management.

![motherboard wired]

That was it! Cable managed to the best of my abilities which isn't
great but will do the job for now!

![ready to close]

Before screwing the front panel on I made sure that it booted
correctly before sealing it up.

So that was pretty sparse on the details and way more pictures than
necessary, here's one more for good measure, the completed case.

![closed case]

## Install operating system

Once I confirmed the build worked then I needed to install an
operating system (OS), for me there wasn't really any doubt for what I
was going to use, Ubuntu!

If you've never installed an OS on a computer before you need the OS
to install. I had Ubuntu 19.04 on a USB sick, you insert it into the
computer then go into the BIOS of the motherboard to select a boot
option.

To get into the BOIS of a system you usually need to repeatedly push
the F2 or Del button to start it.

Ubuntu 19.04 was immediately upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 and things got a
bit weird then, the software sources wouldn't load meaning I couldn't
add any software over what was already installed.

I was able to make a new USB drive with Ubuntu 20.04 and went ahead an
reinstalled it over what I'd already installed.

What I will say for the hardware here is that it took minutes to
install a new operating system. I was blown away at how fast it went
with an SSD.

## Areas for improvement

Although I was glad to get through it all without anything
catastrophic happening there are still some things that could be
improved upon if you're asking me.

The included fan although really useful in helping cut costs isn't the
best due to the height giving less than optimal airflow.

<!-- cSpell:ignore noctua -->

What I have eyed up for a future improvement is the [Noctua
NH-L9a-AM4 33.84 CFM CPU Cooler].

The fan also comes packaged with thermal paste which I could use to
replace the stock paste that cam pre applied to the Ryzen fan.

The case PSU cables are ugly, and there's a lot of redundant cables in
there taking up precious space.

Currently the only storage on there is the 500GB Samsung M.2 drive.
Ideally I'd like to add more storage with a [Samsung 860 Evo 1 TB
2.5" Solid State Drive]

Finally better RAM speed, currently I have 3200 but could go to 3600,
but if I'm going to upgrade the RAM I may as well bump it from 32GB up
to 64GB, but that's in the region of Â£300 so no need for that _yet_.

Check out my completed build here:
https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/pHkrCL

The price wil vary depending on when you look, I got the whole setup
for just over Â£750.

There is no way you will find a laptop with that sort of spec sheet
for that sort of price, believe me I've looked.
