I was listening to James Q Quick on his podcast, he was doing his
origin story and there were some questions being asked and someone
asked this question which got me thinking.

> Did you ever consider giving up?

(This is coming from my privileged background)

The thought never occurred to me.

Sure I've had terrible times at work, but I never thought "You know
what, I'm going to be a carrot farmer instead."

It's strange, because I wasn't in a great spot when I started web
development in late 2016.

I had just parted ways with my last (VBA) client and I was at a
crossing point, I knew the market I was in for the skills I had where
limited.

I could keep on doing what I was doing for a decade (from 2006
to 2016) prior to that in automating Excel spreadsheets for large
financial organisations.

Or I could reskill and work in the place where a lot of the tools I
had worked with 10 years prior to that were all moving to, the
browser.

There were some bumps in the road for me, I started with Python and
the web framework for that Django and I was bewildered with the filing
structure that you needed to follow, I don't recall much else about it
apart from feeling overwhelmed by this crazy filing structure.

I saw a freeCodeCamp post from Quincy which talked about the many uses
of JavaScript and the upshot was bet on JavaScript.

> Bet on JavaScript

From there I started the freeCodeCamp curriculum and set on my way to
become a web developer.
