I was tagged into a conversation over on James Q Quick's Discord about
growth over the last year and it wasn't until I sat down to write
about it that I realised I've done quite a bit over the last 12 months
now.

Most of my content is written and supplemented with video content if
needed.

I've made a load of cool new friends starting on the live stream tip
with you James Q Quick looking at Gatsby recipes in June 2020, I also
helped out with Brad Garropy on his stream to migrate to MDX on his
site.

In June I started co-hosting Whiskey Wednesday with Marc Backes and
met with and spoke to a load of cool people on there.

I documented my [streaming setup] so others could get started themselves.

I did a load of work with Windows Subsystem for Linux, documented a
load of stuff relating to that:

- [Windows Terminal Config]
- [WSL Web Developer Bootstrap with Fedora 33]
- [Fedora Remix for WSL GUI Apps]
- [Use Chrome in Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem Linux]
- [Enable GUIs on Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)]

I [built my first PC] as well, as my Surface clone couldn't hack it any
more.

Made posts on ZSH and how I switched from Fish to ZSH which is now my
default shell, got a retweet from Robby Russel for that!

- [Notes on Zsh and Oh My Zsh]

I [started a newsletter], which by the way I should have done years
ago! and the Wes Bos React Advanced Courses giveaway really helped
with that!

I'd say growth wise if you're looking purely at numbers it's been
pretty steady for me and I'm more about the long tail when it comes to
that sort of thing.

I've become a bit obsessive about note taking and made the front page
of hacker news talking about Foam, I now use Dendron for my note
taking.

- [My Second Brain - Zettelkasten]

I still have really popular posts from the start of 2020 still making
numbers as well making a table of contents in Gatsby, getting started
with Chakra and globally styling the Gatsby default stater with
styled-components.

Oh, spoken at a couple of conferences and meetups.

I did a workshop on 2021-03-30 at a conference for Gatsby and MDX.
