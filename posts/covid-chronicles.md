Unprecedented times, 2020 has been something else, and hopefully
something none of us will have to live through again.

I've decided to take a few notes on what I've been doing in these
unprecedented times.

## Became fully remote

Inset witty meme about _"Who led the digital transformation of your
company"_ here.

I'm privileged to be working in a company that was able to fully
embrace remote working.

Although, remote work was never an option when they were looking to
recruit and the first question you're asked if you tweet out a "we're
hiring" is "do you do remote?".

Me and my team have never been busier and collaborating has been a
breeze with Microsoft Teams.

I know that this is doable for digital teams now and I'm looking to
stay away from London for as long as possible even after we're told
it's "safe to return to work".

## Bought a `.com`

I bit the bullet and bought [scottspence.com], this was partly due to
me deciding to rebrand my blog to a [digital garden] and wanting to be
a bit more serious about how I market myself.

Also it was another opportunity to start fresh with my content.

## Started Grinding My Own Coffee

We all found it hard to get food online and the shop I get my
particular brand of ground coffee I like doesn't do deliveries.

So I found some brands from Amazon but it was a gamble and it wasn't
until I shared my experience in Twitter that I was shown the light!

I bought a hand burr grinder, as per Dave's instruction and bought
some [Amazon brand Solimo Beans].

They're pretty nice and I'm sure I have saved myself a _lot_ of money
which would have otherwise been spent on [COCO DI MAMA] flat whites!

## Built a PC

With all that money I wasn't spending on travelling to London and
buying completely unnecessary and overpriced coffee I had a bit of
extra cash.

Right at this time was when my trusty ASUS Transformer Pro T304UA
decided that was the time for the internal fan to start grinding.

It was a [first time PC build] and there is still areas for improvement
on it but I am really happy with the outcome.

## My Wife Became a Hairdresser

My lockdown hair was getting pretty out of hand so my wife mustered up
the courage to cut my hair after watching some YouTube videos.

### Before

Think this is with the sides already clipped whist we waited for the
scissors to be delivered.

## Appeared on a Live Stream with James Quick

James Quick initially reached out to me to see if we could build an
NPM business card on stream but later decided we would get familiar
with Gatsby recipes.

## Appeared on a Podcast with Rob Kendal

I made a first time appearance on a Podcast

## Started Whiskey Wednesday

Whisky Wednesday was started by my friend [Marc Backes] from our mutual
appreciation of Whiskey.

I think this is when we first discovered we both appreciated a tipple!

And this is what probably cemented the beginnings of the show.

We had a couple of open sessions but weren't broadcast, then Marc
decided to go all in with a live stream, here is the first with a few
guests.

## We're not done yet!

With the end of the lockdown still unsure and the spread of the virus
in some countries on the rise again I'm still not done with lockdown
lyfe!

<!-- cSpell:ignore lyfe -->

If there are more events I'll add there here, for now that's it!

Stay safe!
