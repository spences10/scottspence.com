This is a post that will go over some of the specifics needed to
configure a SvelteKit project using Svelte 5 runes. So this is a
dedicated post for the Svelte 5 integration going over the work done
in previous posts on setting up a project to use Fathom Analytics. If
you want the implementation details for SvelteKit v1 and Svelte 4,
check out the posts.

You can see the demo site over at: https://ideal-memory.com

The code is here: https://github.com/spences10/sveltekit-and-fathom

For specifics on using the Fathom API I suggest taking a look a the
previous posts:

- [Adding real-time analytics to my SvelteKit site with Fathom](https://scottspence.com/posts/caching-with-fathom-redis-and-sveltekit)
- [Caching with Fathom, Redis, and SvelteKit](https://scottspence.com/posts/adding-real-time-analytics-to-my-sveltekit-site-with-fathom)
- [and also the Fathom documentation](https://usefathom.com/api)

## Svelte 4 to Svelte 5 layout changes

I got this working on my site first of all before implementing here,
essentially the changes for Fathom to work is to swap out the
`onMount` function for a `$effect` function. Then another effect to
track the page view on route change.

Here's the Svelte 4 layout:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { browser } from '$app/environment'
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import {
		PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID,
		PUBLIC_FATHOM_URL,
	} from '$env/static/public'
	import Nav from '$lib/components/nav.svelte'
	import * as Fathom from 'fathom-client'
	import { onMount } from 'svelte'
	import '../app.css'
	import type { PageData } from './$types'

	export let data: PageData

	onMount(async () => {
		Fathom.load(PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID, {
			url: PUBLIC_FATHOM_URL,
		})
	})

	$: $page.url.pathname, browser && Fathom.trackPageview()
</script>

<Nav visitors={data?.visitors?.total || 0} />
<main class="container mx-auto mb-20 max-w-3xl px-4">
	<slot />
</main>
```

And here's the Svelte 5 layout:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { browser } from '$app/environment'
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import { env } from '$env/dynamic/public'
	import { Nav } from '$lib/components'
	import * as Fathom from 'fathom-client'
	import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'
	import '../app.css'
	import type { LayoutData } from './$types'

	const { PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID, PUBLIC_FATHOM_URL } = env

	let { data, children } = $props<{
		data: LayoutData
		children: Snippet
	}>()

	$effect(() => {
		if (browser) {
			Fathom.load(PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID, {
				url: PUBLIC_FATHOM_URL,
			})
		}
	})

	// Track page view on route change
	$effect(() => {
		$page.url.pathname, browser && Fathom.trackPageview()
	})
</script>

<Nav visitors={data?.visitors?.total || 0} />
<main class="container mx-auto mb-20 max-w-3xl px-4">
	{@render children()}
</main>
```

So, I'll go over the changes then show the diff.

I'm using `$env/dynamic/public` instead of `$env/static/public` I've
had issues with the static env vars not being available in the
browser, so I'm using the dynamic env vars instead and destructuring
the values I need.

Using the `$props` rune to get the `data` and `children` props instead
of having them passed with `export let`. The `children` prop is a
snippet that is passed to the layout, this is the content of the page
that is being rendered. No more `<slot />`!

The `onMount` function is swapped out for a `$effect` rune. This is
wrapped in a conditional that checks if the browser is available and
loads up the Fathom script.

Then another `$effect` for the `Fathom.trackPageview` function, that
tracks the page view on route change.

That's pretty much it! For the Fathom integration anyway.

The rest of the changes were to use Svelte 5 snippets for the
Analytics Card.

## Conclusion

Simple enough, right? There were a few bumps for me on using `$effect`
for the first loading of the Fathom script, then another one for the
page view tracking. But once I got my head around it, it was pretty
straight forward.

For the rest of the changes, I'll leave that to you to check out in
the repo.
