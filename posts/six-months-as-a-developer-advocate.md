Six months ago today I started a new job as a developer advocate for
GraphCMS. This has taken me by surprise as if feels like I've only
just started still!

<Tweet tweetLink="GraphCMS/status/1387036398314786821" />

I think now is a good time to reflect on what I have done in this
time.

## April recap

I was onboarding for the first two weeks I was there this was mainly
me getting to know my immediate team and key people in the business.
Many one to one video calls.

## May recap

After my onboarding one of the first things I did was [create a
SvelteKit example project] that used the GraphCMS eCommerce example
project. All the examples in the GraphCMS examples repos use the
GraphCMS eCommerce example.

My Svelte love story begins!

<Tweet tweetLink="spences10/status/1389682243925327874" />

Soon after that I was asked to talk with Brittney and Alex about
GraphCMS on the [CodingCat.dev podcast]. This was released in July

I was well on my way down the Svelte and SvelteKit rabbit hole by this
time and started to put out some more written content. [Data Binding
in Svelte] was a refreshing look at how two way data binding worked
with Svelte and how little code you have to write to get it to work.

I went a bit further toward the end of May with a [SvelteKit Starter
Blog with GraphCMS], using the GraphCMS blog schema template.

## June recap

Back to the GraphCMS examples, I created an explainer video to
accompany each of the examples in the [GraphCMS examples] repo.

Twenty odd videos between two and six minutes each, this is when I
started taking video editing seriously.

<YouTube listId='PL5SvzogSTpeH1Szqw4tPi9ZfgXDbY8GU-'/>

These videos took up a lot of time and effort to make for something so
short!

## July recap

A brief blog post on the GraphCMS [Examples video series].

Then a quite lengthy blog post on [Building a Personal Timeline with
GraphCMS and SvelteKit]. What I learned from this is that some content
doesn't quite fit written format.

I was on a family holiday for the last week of July.

## August recap

I was away on holiday for the first half of August.

The first couple of days back from holiday Jamie and I came up with
the idea of creating a full [Jamstack Linktree clone] that could be
created with one click.

Then I started on the [Jamstack explorers mission]

## September recap

Busy month from what I can recall!

First up was a nice chat with my Twitter buddy James Perkins

https://zencastr.com/z/TARGseQu

Then I released a SvelteKit crash course video on YouTube.

<YouTube youTubeId='zH2qG9YwN3s'/>

I was asked to do a live stream with Eddie Jaoude where we made a full
stack CRUD app with Svelte.

<YouTube youTubeId='aCP6sEvmYU4'/>

The [Jamstack explorers mission] was [announced by Netlify] and I
followed up [with a blog post] on the GraphCMS blog.

## Conclusion

So now I've listed off what I've done in the last several months, I
can see I have been quite busy!

<!-- cSpell:ignore Pranshu,Khanna -->

I have had periods of overwhelming imposter syndrome, at points like
this I have had colleagues like [Pranshu Khanna] highlight some of my
past achievements, which is one of the reasons I've put this post
together.

Which brings me to my team! I'm thankful for is a really supportive
team and manager ([Jamie Barton]) that believes in me and the content
I'm producing. Before I started at GraphCMS I never thought I'd be
putting out the amount of content I have produced.

What I have listed here is actual content and doesn't include all the
planning and co-ordination with the rest of the team. Helping out with
the community in the public Slack, speaking with other companies and
individuals about collaborations and partnerships.

The GraphQL ecosystem and the Svelte ecosystem is a big part of what
I'm doing now. I really feel like I'm only just getting started!!
