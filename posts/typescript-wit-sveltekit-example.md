I've started using TypeScript on every new project I start with
Svelte. My buddy Jamie Barton has helped me out with getting set up
with the GraphQL Code Generator so that data is typed in the project.

This is a _just so you know_ kind of guide as there is
[KitQL](https://kitql.vercel.app/) as an alternative which will
generate all the types you need for your GraphQL schema for use in
your SvelteKit projects.

In this guide I'll be setting up a SvelteKit skeleton project with a
GraphCMS backend to demonstrate how to set up with GraphQL Code
Generator. I'll be using the GraphCMS Blog Starter template in the
examples here. You can generate your own from the starter section on
the `app.graphcms.com` page or clone the project I'm using [with
this link].

## Setup SvelteKit project

Usual fare with this, use the CLI to create a new project. So from the
command line I'll scaffold out a new SvelteKit skeleton project. One
thing to note is that the `@next` isn't needed any more, this
**doesn't** mean that SvelteKit is at v1 though like I have said in
the past.

```bash
npm init svelte sveltekit-graphql-codegen
```

I'll chose the following options from the CLI prompt, yes to all the
things:

```text
✔ Which Svelte app template? › Skeleton project
✔ Use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Add ESLint for code linting? … Yes
✔ Add Prettier for code formatting? … Yes
✔ Add Playwright for browser testing? … Yes
```

I'll change directory (`cd`) into the newly created project and I'll
install `graphql-request` and `graphql` as regular dependencies. I've
seen peer dependency issues in the past and GraphQL Code Generator
flat out doesn't work if they're installed as dev dependencies for
some reason.

Yes, I'm using `pnpm` for the installation of the dependencies, you do
you though, use `npm`, `yarn`, whatever, live your life!

```bash
pnpm i graphql-request graphql
```

I'll then install the dev dependencies needed, I'll list them here and
you can copy them from the code block below if you need it!

- `@graphql-codegen/cli`
- `@graphql-codegen/typescript`
- `@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations`
- `@graphql-codegen/typed-document-node`
- `@graphql-typed-document-node/core`

```bash
pnpm i -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typed-document-node @graphql-typed-document-node/core
```

## Setup GraphQL Code Generator

Now that I've got all the dependencies I need I'll need to configure
GraphQL Code Generator.

```bash
touch codegen.yml .env
```

I'm also creating a `.env` file to store the `VITE_GRAPHQL_API` that's
going to store the endpoint of my GraphQL API as I'm not a fan of
hardcoding anything that can be a variable.

In the `codegen.yml` file I'll add the following:

```yaml
schema: ${VITE_GRAPHQL_API}
documents:
  - '**/*.{graphql,gql}'
generates:
  src/lib/graphql/types.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
      - typed-document-node
    config:
      useTypeImports: true
```

The `codegen.yml` file here is telling the GraphQL Code Generator to
create the `types.ts` file in the `src/lib/graphql` folder. It will
run the `plugins` of `typescript`, `typescript-operations` and
`typed-document-node` against the `schema` for any `documents`
(GraphQL files) matching `**/*.{graphql,gql}`.

Now the GraphQL Code Generator is going to look for a `.graphql` or
`.gql` file, so I'll create a `all-posts.graphql` file that will query
for all the posts.

```bash
# make the directory
mkdir -p src/lib/graphql
# create the file
touch src/lib/graphql/all-posts.graphql
```

I'll add the following to the `all-posts.graphql` file:

```graphql
query AllPosts {
	posts {
		title
		slug
		date
		excerpt
		tags
	}
}
```

In my `.env` file I'll add the endpoint of my GraphQL API, I'm using a
GraphCMS project.

```bash
VITE_GRAPHQL_API=https://api-eu.graphcms.com/v2/project-id/master
```

I'll need to let the GraphQL Code Generator know where to get the
config for the variable I'm using in the `.yml` file. I'll do that
with creating a `generate` script in the `package.json` file.

I'll also tack on the `generate` script at the end of the `prepare`
script so that if there's any changes to the `.graphql` files it'll
run the `generate` script after `pnpm install` has run.

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate": "graphql-codegen --require dotenv/config",
  "prepare": "svelte-kit sync && pnpm run generate",
}
```

Ok now I'm ready to go! Run the `generate` script and I get the
following CLI output:

```text
> graphql-codegen --require dotenv/config

  ✔ Parse configuration
  ❯ Generate outputs
  ✔ Parse configuration
  ✔ Generate outputs
```

Now I can go over to the `src/lib/graphql` folder and I can see the
`types.ts` file has been generated.

## Using the generated types

What I'm looking for in the `types.ts` file is the `AllPostsDocument`,
it's right at the bottom of the file. If we take a look at that here:

```ts
export const AllPostsDocument = {
	kind: 'Document',
	definitions: [
		{
			kind: 'OperationDefinition',
			operation: 'query',
			name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'AllPosts' },
			selectionSet: {
				kind: 'SelectionSet',
				selections: [
					{
						kind: 'Field',
						name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'posts' },
						selectionSet: {
							kind: 'SelectionSet',
							selections: [
								{
									kind: 'Field',
									name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'title' },
								},
								{
									kind: 'Field',
									name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'slug' },
								},
								{
									kind: 'Field',
									name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'date' },
								},
								{
									kind: 'Field',
									name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'excerpt' },
								},
								{
									kind: 'Field',
									name: { kind: 'Name', value: 'tags' },
								},
							],
						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	],
} as unknown as DocumentNode<AllPostsQuery, AllPostsQueryVariables>
```

And contrast the `selectionSet` in the `AllPostsDocument` export to
the `query` in the `all-posts.graphql` file:

```graphql
query AllPosts {
	posts {
		title
		slug
		date
		excerpt
		tags
	}
}
```

I can see that it's matching the `posts` fields in the `AllPosts`
query.

## Use types in my code

So in this example I'm going to write out the query to the API in the
`src/routes/index.svelte` file for brevity. This can be abstracted out
into other files if you want.

Now if I make a request to the GraphQL API with `graphql-request` I
can use the `AllPostsDocument` for the query rather than writing out
the query in backticks. Something like this:

```ts
const client = new GraphQLClient(import.meta.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_API)

const { posts } = await client.request(AllPostsDocument)
```

The `graphql-request` can now take the generics for the `DocumentNode`
(`AllPostsDocument`) query and variables, and I can assign the type of
a `Post[]` array to the destructured property from it like this:

```ts
const client = new GraphQLClient(import.meta.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_API)

const { posts } = (await client.request<
	AllPostsQuery,
	AllPostsQueryVariables
>(AllPostsDocument)) as { posts: Post[] }
```

Pretty neat, now I can return the props from the
`script context="module"` to the page and assign the `Post[]` type to
it:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let posts: Post[]
</script>
```

Here's what the full `src/routes/index.svelte` file looks like with
the imported types from the `types.ts` file:

```svelte
<script context="module" lang="ts">
	import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request'
	import {
		AllPostsDocument,
		type AllPostsQuery,
		type AllPostsQueryVariables,
		type Post,
	} from '../lib/graphql/types'

	export const load = async () => {
		const client = new GraphQLClient(import.meta.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_API)

		const { posts } = (await client.request<
			AllPostsQuery,
			AllPostsQueryVariables
		>(AllPostsDocument)) as { posts: Post[] }

		return { props: { posts } }
	}
</script>

<script lang="ts">
	export let posts: Post[]
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)}</pre>
```

<!-- cSpell:ignore stringifying -->

I'm JSON stringifying the `posts` array in a `<pre>` tag so that I can
see the data is being returned from the API as I expect.

I can now take this further and work with the data being returned from
the API by adding it to some markup on the page.

## Conclusion

I've set up and configured the GraphQL Code Generator and plugins on a
project and used the generated types in my code.

I can now use type safe code in my Svelte project!
