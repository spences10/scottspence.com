For the past couple of weeks I have slowly been getting a more
comfortable with [Toast]

The best way to do that would be to make a project with it, I decided
to move my blog to Toast.

## Files

The way my Gatsby blog files are organised are a nested structure of
content, posts, YYYY, MM, DD, subject, index.mdx, for this post it
looks like this:

```text
this-project-toast/
├─ content/2021/
│  ├─ 01
│  ├─ 02
│  ├─ 03
│  │  └─ 12/notes-on-toast/
│  │    └─ index.mdx
├─ src/
├─ static/
... more files
```

No more Markdown comments, MDX doesn't support the html comments you
could add into my MDX files so they had to go.

I mainly used html comments to organise my links in my posts, see the
[Markdown Showdown] for more on that if you're interested. I means that
the links I'd have at the bottom of a post wouldn't be labelled links,
resources, images, etc.

```html

## Preact

I've used Preact in a project professionally before

```jsx
/** @jsx h */
import { h } from 'preact'
```

## Snowpack

[Snowpack] is a lightweight frontend build tool alternative to webpack
or Parcel. Snowpack leverages JavaScript's native module system,
[ESM].

Snowpack will bundle up the browser modules for me on postinstall

## Cloudinary

Jason Lengstorf created [rehype-local-image-to-cloudinary]

## Tailwind CSS

I've not used Tailwind CSS on a project before so this is a good
learning experience for me
