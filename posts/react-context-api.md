Let's use the React Context API to change theme in an app!

This is what it will look like by the end of this post:

![theme switching in react app]

## But first, some **context**! ü§£

Ok terrible puns aside let's have a look at what the React Context API
is for and what it does. There's a great one liner from the [React docs]...

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree
> without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Or in other words, you can use the React Context API to avoid [prop
drilling] if you need more detail on the concept then please do check out
the links provided.

I've previously gone over implementing the React Context API in [my
Gatsby blog] which I documented as I did it; you can see [how
that went here].

## What we're doing...

For this post we're going to extend the example we created for
[styled-components getting started] as it has the majority of the code
we'll need to get started with the React Context API.

We're going to extend that example to manage the theme state of the
example application.

So in summary:

- Scaffold out basic CreateReact App
- Use styled-components üíÖ for styling
- Add themes to switch between with the React Context API
- Use the React Context API!

## What we'll need...

All we'll be needing is an internet connection and a modern web
browser! Because we're going to do all of this online in the awesome
[CodeSandbox]!

If you have a GitHub account or not, CodeSandbox will let you get
started [coding straight away]!

### Versions:

**This guide is being used with the following dependency versions.**

- react: 16.4.2
- react-dom: 16.4.2
- react-scripts: 1.1.4
- styled-components: 3.4.5

---

## Let's start

So let's go over theming the basic create react app again, this time
instead of adding state into to the component we will use the React
Context API to manage the state for us. There will be people that will
argue that this is a bit overkill for a theme switch but it is given
as an example of [when to use the Context API] in the React documentation
so I will let you decide on the validity of that point. For this example,
I hope it will give you a clearer picture of how to use the Context API
in an application.

### Dependencies

[Open a React CodeSandbox] and add `styled-components` as a dependency:

![codesandbox initial]

### File structure

Another area for [bikeshedding] is file structure, in this scenario
we're adding folders for `components`, `contexts` and the `theme`
please feel free to structure your files how you see fit, this is how
we're going to do it for this example ‚ù§Ô∏è

Add the directories into the `src` folder so we can add in some
components, the file structure should look something like this:

```bash
context-demo/
‚îú‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ contexts/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ theme/
‚îî‚îÄ package.json
```

## Scaffold out a basic Create React App

Ok, so, what we're going to do is add in an `App.js` component to the
`components` folder then use that in the `src/index.js` file.

The `App.js` component can be a [stateless functional component] as
for this example as we're going to be handling state with the Context
API.

Here you can see my sketchy typing as I create the directories and add
in the `App.js` component.

![codesandbox 1]

We can then remove the `style.css` file and reference in
`src/index.js` as we're going to be styling with styled-components üíÖ
and then use our `App.js` component:

![codesandbox 2]

Ok, so the reason why I have abstracted the `App.js` component out of
the `src/index.js` file is so that when we come to using the Context
API we can add it to the highest level in our app, which is
`src/index.js`.

### What about the rest?

So this isn't really the Create React App, as we're using CodeSandbox
instead, I have gone over the basic styling used in the
[styled-components getting started] post so it's time to refer to that
to mimic the styles we need.

That means what we're going to do, rather than go into depth on the
styling of each of the component parts that make up the basic Create
React App appearance, we're going to re-use components, so there's
going to be a bit of copy pasting involved now.

The Create React App boilerplate code has one file that we go over
styling in the [styled-components getting started] post which is the
`App.js` file, the others are left or deleted, the basic style of
`App.js` is:

**`App.css`**

```css
.App {
	text-align: center;
}

.App-logo {
	animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
	height: 80px;
}

.App-header {
	background-color: #222;
	height: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	color: white;
}

.App-title {
	font-size: 1.5em;
}

.App-intro {
	font-size: large;
}

@keyframes App-logo-spin {
	from {
		transform: rotate(0deg);
	}
	to {
		transform: rotate(360deg);
	}
}
```

## Use styled components for styling

Now we're going to recreate the styles from the `App.css` file with
styled-components, let's list them out here and go through them:

```bash
AppWrapper
AppHeader
AppTitle
rotate360
AppLogo
# We're adding our own styles for
AppIntro
Underline
StyledHyperLink
Button
```

`AppWrapper` is the top level wrapper which in a larger component
could be used for layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox, in our case we're
going to align the text center.

![codesandbox 3]

Straightforward enough, right? Now the majority of the rest of the
components will use the styled-components [`ThemeProvider`] which is
what we're going to pass our theme to from the Context API.

## Add themes to switch between with the React Context API

Ok, we need to define some themes to pass to the `ThemeProvider`,
we're going to define several theme aspects we want to change, these
are going to be:

```js
primary // colour
secondary // colour
danger // colour
fontHeader // font
fontBody // font
```

Create a file to contain the theme object in the `theme` directory and
call it `globalStyle.js` and add in the following:

<!-- cSpell:ignore Enriqueta,Kaushan -->

```js
import { injectGlobal } from 'styled-components'

export const themes = {
	theme1: {
		primary: '#ff0198',
		secondary: '#01c1d6',
		danger: '#e50000',
		fontHeader: 'Old Standard TT, sans, sans-serif',
		fontBody: 'Nunito, sans-serif',
	},

	theme2: {
		primary: '#6e27c5',
		secondary: '#ffb617',
		danger: '#ff1919',
		fontHeader: 'Enriqueta, sans-serif',
		fontBody: 'Exo 2, sans, sans-serif',
	},

	theme3: {
		primary: '#f16623',
		secondary: '#2e2e86',
		danger: '#cc0000',
		fontHeader: 'Kaushan Script, sans, sans-serif',
		fontBody: 'Headland One, sans-serif',
	},
}

injectGlobal`
  @import url('
    https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=
    Old+Standard+TT:400,700|
    Nunito:400,700'|
    Enriqueta:400,700|
    Exo+2:400,700|
    Kaushan+Script:400,700|
    Headland+One:400,700|
  ');

  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
  }
`
```

![codesandbox 4]

Ok, so nothing really happening there apart from setting up the styles
for use later.

You will notice that `injectGlobal` is being used here, this is where
we're setting the fonts for use throughout the app, `injectGlobal`
[should be used once] in an app to set global styles like this.

Onwards! Let us now focus on getting the basic app styles into the
`App.js` component. We can now start using the `ThemeProvider` in
`App.js`. To do this, for now, to get some visual feedback we're going
to apply one of the themes from the `themes` object in
`globalStyle.js` this is so, as we are adding in components we can see
the theme being applied.

We can do this now with the `AppHeader` which is a styled div:

```js
const AppHeader = styled.div`
	height: 12rem;
	padding: 1rem;
	color: ${({ theme }) => theme.dark};
	background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
`
```

You will notice here that we're beginning to use the
styled-components, `theme` props but, if we paste this code in now
there won't be any change until the `ThemeProvider` is passed the
`theme` object so we're going to wrap `App.js` with the
`ThemeProvider` component so that any component encapsulated by the
`ThemeProvider` is able to receive `theme` props.

![codesandbox 5]

`AppTitle` is going to be a h1 so:

```js
const AppTitle = styled.h1`
	font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontHeader};
`
```

For the spinning React logo we can use the asset used previously in
the [styled-components getting started example]

We can add it in with the imports at the top of the `App.js` component
and add it into the `AppLogo` styled component as an `img` tag:

```js
const logo = `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/
    234708/37256552-32635a02-2554-11e8-8fe3-8ab5bd969d8e.png`
```

The `keyframes` helper will need to be imported alongside the
`ThemeProvider` for the animation on the react logo.

```js
const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from { 
    transform: rotate(0deg); 
  }
  to { 
    transform: rotate(360deg); 
  }
`

const AppLogo = styled.img`
	animation: ${rotate360} infinite 5s linear;
	height: 80px;
	&:hover {
		animation: ${rotate360} infinite 1s linear;
	}
`
```

![codesandbox 6]

### Shared components

Shared components are covered in the [styled-components
getting started] guide if you need more information, for this example
we're going to bring in the final couple of components as shared ones
for the `StyledHyperLink` and `Button` in `src/Shared.js` add the
following:

**`src/Shared.js`**

```js
import styled, { css } from 'styled-components'

export const Button = styled.button`
	padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
	margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
	color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
	font-size: 1rem;
	box-shadow: 0 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	cursor: pointer;
	border: 2px solid ${props => props.border};
	background-color: Transparent;
	text-transform: uppercase;
	border-radius: 4px;
	transition: all 0.1s;
	&:hover {
		transform: translateY(1px);
		box-shadow: 0 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
	}
	${props =>
		props.primary &&
		css`
			background: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
			border: 2px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
			color: white;
		`};
	${props =>
		props.danger &&
		css`
			background: ${({ theme }) => theme.danger};
			border: 2px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.danger};
			color: white;
		`};
	&:hover {
		transform: translateY(2px);
		box-shadow: 0 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
	}
`

export const StyledHyperLink = styled.a`
	cursor: pointer;
	&:visited,
	&:active {
		color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
	}
	&:hover {
		color: ${({ theme }) => theme.secondary};
	}
	color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
`
```

Then import the components like any other:

![codesandbox 7]

The last three components for now, `AppIntro`, `Underline` and
`StyledHyperLink`:

```js
const AppIntro = styled.p`
	color: ${({ theme }) => theme.dark};
	font-size: large;
	code {
		font-size: 1.3rem;
	}
	font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontBody};
`

const Underline = styled.span`
	border-bottom: 4px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.secondary};
`

const StyledHyperLink = SHL.extend`
	text-decoration: none;
	font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontBody};
	color: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontDark};
`
```

![codesandbox 8]

Add them in under the `AppLogo` styled component and then we can add
the rest of the components into the `App` function `return`, so, ready
for another [copy pasta]? Here:

```js
<AppIntro>
  Bootstrapped with{' '}
  <Underline>
    <code>
      <StyledHyperLink
        href={`https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app`}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
      >
        create-react-app
      </StyledHyperLink>
    </code>
  </Underline>.
</AppIntro>
<AppIntro>
  Components styled with{' '}
  <Underline>
    <code>
      <StyledHyperLink
        href={`https://www.styled-components.com`}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
      >
        styled-components
      </StyledHyperLink>
    </code>
  </Underline>{' '}
  <span role="img" aria-label="nail polish">
    üíÖ
  </span>
</AppIntro>
<AppIntro>
  Fonts picked with{' '}
  <Underline>
    <code>
      <StyledHyperLink
        href={`https://fontjoy.com/`}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
      >
        fontjoy.com
      </StyledHyperLink>
    </code>
  </Underline>
</AppIntro>
<Button>Normal Button</Button>
<Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
<Button danger>Danger Button</Button>
```

Sorry for the code wall! Right paste that in under the closing
`</AppHeader>` tag and we should have the base of what we're going to
theme!

![codesandbox 9]

Ok? How's it looking?

Now we have a basic React app that uses styled-components!

## Use the React Context API

Now for the main event! Here we're going to cover:

- Making the theme context.

- Using the context API with a component.

- Consuming the Context API in multiple components.

So, passing state needlessly through components is what we can use the
Context API to avoid. If we take a look at the [styled-components
getting started example] we can see the state being managed in the `App.js`
component and the `handleThemeChange` function has to be passed to the
`ThemeSelect` component much the same way as any props would need to be
passed down. That is a simplified example but it's quite easy to imagine
if that component lived on a footer component or a menu item there would
be several other components that would need to have the state passed through
them that would not actually need that state or props. Make sense?

**example**

```js
<App>               {/* state begins here */}
  <Header>          {/* through here */}
    <Navigation>    {/* and here */}
      <ThemeSelect> {/* to be used here */}
    </Navigation>
  </Header>
  <Footer/>
</App>
```

### Add the site theme context

In our `src/contexts/` directory we're going to make our
`SiteThemeContext.js`, import React and define and export our context:

```js
import React from 'react'

export const SiteThemeContext = React.createContext()
```

### So what is a context?

A context is made up of two things, a provider and a consumer, you
have a single provider which will sit up as high as possible in the
component tree so that multiple consumers can get the state and props
from the provider.

Hopefully you recall the point at which we abstracted the
`function App` component out of the `src/index.js` file, this is so we
could add in the context provider at the highest level of the app, in
the `src/index.js` file. This means that any consumer within the app,
no matter how deep into the component tree it is, it can get the state
and props from that top level.

Now to create a provider, the provider is a regular React component,
so:

```js
import React from 'react'

export const SiteThemeContext = React.createContext()

export class SiteThemeProvider extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <SiteThemeContext.Provider value={}>
        {this.props.children}
      </SiteThemeContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}
```

What is being returned by `<SiteThemeProvider>` is the
`<SiteThemeContext.Provider>` and the children of that component, the
one prop you have to provide the the provider is a `value` prop. This
is the variable that the consumer has access to. The consumer being
`<SiteThemeContext.Consumer>` (more on this shortly).

So what we can do now is have what is passed into `value` be an object
`value={{}}` so it can store multiple properties of the state and the
functions that are defined in `SiteThemeContext`.

The state for the context needs to be the `theme` so we need to import
the theme from `src/theme/globalStyle` and add that to the state,
we're going to default the theme (and state) to `theme1` and add a
copy of that into the `value` prop by spreading into state `...‚ù§Ô∏è`, it
should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

import { themes } from '../theme/globalStyle'

export const SiteThemeContext = React.createContext()

export class SiteThemeProvider extends React.Component {
	state = {
		theme: themes['theme1'],
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<SiteThemeContext.Provider
				value={{
					...this.state,
				}}
			>
				{this.props.children}
			</SiteThemeContext.Provider>
		)
	}
}
```

Ok, it's been a while since I've added a gif, time for another one!

![codesandbox 10]

And bring in the `themes` and add state:

![codesandbox 11]

Now we can add in a function to the provider to change the theme state
based on what has been selected via the `handleThemeChange` event
value:

```js
handleThemeChange = e => {
	const key = e.target.value
	const theme = themes[key]
	this.setState({ theme })
}
```

This can then be consumed by any provider that wants to use it, we're
going to need to add it into the `value` prop, like this:

```js
import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

import { themes } from '../theme/globalStyle'

export const SiteThemeContext = React.createContext()

export class SiteThemeProvider extends React.Component {
	state = {
		theme: themes['theme1'],
	}

	handleThemeChange = e => {
		const key = e.target.value
		const theme = themes[key]
		this.setState({ theme })
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<SiteThemeContext.Provider
				value={{
					...this.state,
					handleThemeChange: this.handleThemeChange,
				}}
			>
				{this.props.children}
			</SiteThemeContext.Provider>
		)
	}
}
```

Ok, that is the site theme context component covered, pretty straight
forward, right?

What I should mention is that the `e` in the `handleThemeChange`
function is going to be the event from the theme select box that we're
about to make.

Let's go through adding in the function and adding that to the state:

![codesandbox 12]

And now we can add the theme provider to `src/index.js` so anything
lower in the dependency tree can access it via a consumer.

![codesandbox 13]

### Add the theme select

Now we want a want to call the `handleThemeChange` function that is
part of the `SiteThemeProvider` via the `SiteThemeContext`! I'm sure
this all making perfect sense right now (ü§£) so let's get right in
there and define the component that we're going to use to consume the
`SiteThemeContext.Provider` with a `ThemeSelect` component!

In the `src/components` directory add a new `ThemeSelect.js`
component, this is where we are going to consume the site theme
context with a consumer.

The child of a consumer isn't a component it's a function, so what
we're going to need to do is have the theme select inside the return
of that function.

Let's first set up the styled-components that will make up the select,
which is a select box, some options and a wrapper.

First we'll do it without the consumer then we'll add it in.

**`ThemeSelect.js`**

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

import { themes } from '../theme/globalStyle'

const SelectWrapper = styled.div`
	margin: 0rem 0.5rem 0rem 0.25rem;
	padding: 0rem 0.5rem 0rem 0.25rem;
`

const Select = styled.select`
	margin: 1.5rem 0.5rem;
	padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
	font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontBody};
	border: 2px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.secondary};
	box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	background: ${({ theme }) => theme.foreground};
	border-radius: 4px;
`

export const SelectOpt = styled.option`
	font-family: ${({ theme }) => theme.fontBody};
`

const ThemeSelect = props => {
	return (
		<SelectWrapper>
			<Select>
				{Object.keys(themes).map((theme, index) => {
					return (
						<SelectOpt key={index} value={theme}>
							Theme {index + 1}
						</SelectOpt>
					)
				})}
			</Select>
		</SelectWrapper>
	)
}

export default ThemeSelect
```

![codesandbox 14]

So from this we can list the this themes available to us in the
`themes` object. But that's it, the function to handle the theme
change lives on the `SiteThemeProvider`.

Back to the `SiteThemeContext.Consumer` as I mentioned earlier the
child of a consumer is a function `() => ()` the first section is the
`value` from the provider (`<SiteThemeContext.Provider>`) so let's
take a quick look at what we've previously defined in the provider:

```js
value={{
  ...this.state,
  handleThemeChange: this.handleThemeChange
}}
```

Available from `SiteThemeContext.Provider` is the state and a function
so any of those items we can extract and pass to the provider, or to
put it another way the consumer can access those values.

Here we can use destructuring to pull the `handleThemeChange` function
we need to change the theme.

```js
import React from 'react'

import { SiteThemeContext } from '../contexts/SiteThemeContext'

const ThemeSelect = props => {
  return (
    <SiteThemeContext.Consumer>
      {({ handleThemeChange }) => ()}
    </SiteThemeContext.Consumer>
  )
}

export default ThemeSelect
```

![codesandbox 15]

Currently this isn't going to change the theme because we have that
hardcoded into the styled-components `ThemeProvider`, what we want to
do is use a consumer for the currently selected theme in the
`SiteThemeContext`.

Before that we'll also need to add in the `onChange` event we want to
use to pass the event (`e`) to the `handleThemeChange` function on
`SiteThemeContext`.

Then in the `App` component we can import our
`<SiteThemeContext.Consumer>` to consume the `theme` on the
`SiteThemeContext` state and pass that to the styled-components
`ThemeProvider`.
