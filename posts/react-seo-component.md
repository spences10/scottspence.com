Here's some of the reasoning and detail that went into making the
[React SEO Component].

There wasn't a **great** deal I knew about Search Engine Optimization
before I set about writing the [Build a coding blog from scratch with
Gatsby and MDX] guide that I published last year.

I'd say I know a _bit_ more now but I still feel it's a bit of a black
art.

One of the main reasons I made the component to get around having to
document the process of making an SEO component that needed to go into
the Build a Blog guide. It was when I was getting toward the end of
writing the guide when I realised that the SEO part of the site was
quite involved.

To begin with I started looking around to see if anyone had created an
SEO component for Gatsby and found a closed [GitHub PR on seo] from Dustin
Schau with some [great notes from Andrew Welch] on SEO and a link to a
presentation he did back in 2017, great stuff.

## Gatsby SEO

<!-- cSpell:ignore leko,prismic -->

Adding an SEO component to a Gatsby site is [well documented] and I, like
a lot of other people developing in Gatsby took [Jason Lengstorf]'s'
lead with the example used on [Marisa's site]. I'd used this several times
already so was familiar with how it worked. The example that captured my
imagination however was from [LekoArts] in his Gatsby Starter Prismic example.

## Open Graph

We all want to have the cool preview cards you see when someone shares
a post on Twitter or LinkedIn. This is done with Facebook's [Open
Graph Protocol] where you add in metadata tags that are picked up by
Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. to display the image added in the tags.

I did some work on an internal project where I work which uses this to
display the `og:image` URL from pages. I was familiar with OGP but not
entirely familiar with the whole adding metadata to the `<head>` of a
site.

## The component

Each time I wanted to add the SEO metadata to a site I had to go find
a project that I had added it to in the past and jack the code from
there and use it in the new project.

There was a lot of wiring things up involved, even when it's a lift
and drop there's usually something slightly different in the props
being passed to the metadata tags.

If you take a look at LeKoArts' example there are three files for
Facebook, Twitter and the SEO.

## Facebook

Facebook has it's set of `<meta>` tags that need to have data passed
to them:

```jsx
<Helmet>
	<meta property="og:locale" content={locale} />
	<meta property="og:url" content={url} />
	<meta property="og:type" content={type} />
	<meta property="og:title" content={title} />
	<meta property="og:description" content={desc} />
	<meta property="og:image" content={image} />
	<meta property="og:image:alt" content={desc} />
</Helmet>
```

## Twitter

Twitter has it's tags too:

```jsx
<Helmet>
	{username && <meta name="twitter:creator" content={username} />}
	<meta name="twitter:card" content={type} />
	<meta name="twitter:title" content={title} />
	<meta name="twitter:description" content={desc} />
	<meta name="twitter:image" content={image} />
	<meta name="twitter:image:alt" content={desc} />
</Helmet>
```

## SEO has it's things as well

Then there's keeping Google sweet as well with [structured data] this is
so Google can understand the contents of the page. I took LekoArts' lead
on this as it was something I wasn't familiar with at all. LekoArts did
a great job of putting all this together:

```jsx
<>
	<Helmet title={seo.title} titleTemplate={`%s | ${titleTemplate}`}>
		<html lang={siteLanguage ? siteLanguage : 'en'} />
		<link rel="canonical" href={pathname} />
		<meta name="description" content={seo.description} />

		{!article && (
			<script type="application/ld+json">
				{JSON.stringify(schemaOrgWebPage)}
			</script>
		)}
		{article && (
			<script type="application/ld+json">
				{JSON.stringify(schemaArticle)}
			</script>
		)}
		<script type="application/ld+json">
			{JSON.stringify(breadcrumb)}
		</script>
	</Helmet>
	<Facebook
		desc={seo.description}
		image={image}
		title={seo.title}
		type={article ? 'article' : 'website'}
		url={pathname}
		locale={siteLocale ? siteLocale : 'en_gb'}
	/>
	<Twitter
		title={seo.title}
		image={image}
		desc={seo.description}
		username={twitterUsername}
	/>
</>
```

There's a lot more to this but for the sake of brevity I'm adding what
the component returns. This is largely unchanged in the the component
I made but for a few variables added.

## Make it a thing

I wanted to be able to `yarn add` this rather than have to go pick out
the components from another project each time.

It was interesting trying to find how to do it, I didn't find a great
deal of documentation out there.

I found [this post] with some [example code] on GitHub.

<!-- cSpell:ignore tsdx -->

The initial release [used Rollup] with Babel preset for React which worked
fine. I've since moved it to use TypeScript with the awesome TSDX for [TypeScript
package
development].

## Enjoy

There's still a lot to do with the component, currently I'm
overwriting some of the tags in this project after writing a
serverless function to generate [Open Graph Images with Gatsby
and Now] which uses these tags:

```jsx
<meta property="og:image" content={ogImageUrl} />
<meta name="twitter:image:src" content={ogImageUrl} />
```

The defaults are empty strings or a default `J Doe` so not great but
there is a lot to go in there and hopefully a lot more to learn from
it by me.
