During a workshop I was hosting at CityJS (<DD date="2023-03-29"/>
ago) for getting started with Svelte and SvelteKit, I received some
valuable feedback from an attendee who was unclear about the role of
the load function in SvelteKit.

This prompted me to revisit this topic and provide a more in-depth
explanation for developers new to SvelteKit. In this post, I'll focus
on understanding the load function in SvelteKit and how it's used.

So, to do that, first I'm going to need to explain routing and the
file notation in SvelteKit. ðŸ˜…

## Routing in SvelteKit

In SvelteKit, the `+` file notation is used to indicate that a file is
part of a route. If I take a look at the `src/routes` directory in the
SvelteKit skeleton it looks like this:

```text
â””â”€â”€ +page.svelte
```

So, in the example above, running the dev server (`pnpm run dev`) and
visiting `localhost:5173` will render the `+page.svelte` file.

<Banner options={skeleton_info} />

Each route can have _one_ or _many_ of the following files:

```text
+page.svelte
+page.ts
+page.server.ts
+layout.svelte
+layout.ts
+layout.server.ts
+error.svelte
+server.ts
```

At a high level, here's a summary of what each file does:

- `+page.svelte`: represents a page, it is a standalone file that will
  be rendered when the corresponding route is accessed.
- `+page.ts`: a module that exports a `load` function that fetches
  data for a page.
- `+page.server.ts`: exports `load` function that will be run on the
  server.
- `+layout.svelte`: a layout component that wraps multiple pages,
  allowing you to share components across pages.
- `+layout.ts`: a module that exports a `load` function that fetches
  data for the layout component. This data is available to all child
  pages.
- `+layout.server.ts`: exports `load` function that will be run on the
  server.
- `+error.svelte`: a special page that is rendered when an error
  occurs during loading or rendering of a page.
- `+server.ts`: used to define custom API routes (endpoints) that
  handle HTTP requests.

I'll dig into these more in the following sections.

This is a basic idea of what the file notation in SvelteKit is used
for, I'll also take a look at component props (short for properties)
in SvelteKit.

## Component props

In Svelte components, `export let` is used to declare a variable as a
prop, which allows it to receive data from a parent component.

In the following example, the `name` prop is declared and set to
`World` by default.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let name = 'World'
</script>

<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
```

In the parent, be that a Svelte component or a SvelteKit
`+page.svelte` route, the `name` prop can be set to a different value.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import Greeting from './Greeting.svelte'
</script>

<Greeting name="Svelte" />
```

Why `export let` though?

I'll refer to the [MDN reference for `export`] which states:

> The export declaration is used to export values from a JavaScript
> module. Exported values can then be imported into other programs
> with the import declaration or dynamic import. The value of an
> imported binding is subject to change in the module that exports it
> â€” when a module updates the value of a binding that it exports, the
> update will be visible in its imported value.

In essence this ensures that when a component prop changes it will
update the value of the prop in the parent component.

This also enables two-way binding, which is a feature of Svelte. More
on that in the [Data Binding in Svelte] post I did a few years back.

## Adding additional routes

If I wanted to add a route for `/about`, I'd need to create a
directory (or folder) with a `+page.svelte` file in that directory.

I can do this with a bash command like this:

```bash
mkdir src/routes/about
touch src/routes/about/+page.svelte
```

The folder structure would look like this now:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ +page.svelte
â””â”€â”€ +page.svelte
```

In the `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` file, I can add some content to
render.

```svelte
<h1>This is the about page</h1>
```

Now, if I visit `localhost:5173/about`, I'll see the `+page.svelte`
for the about route.

## Data loading

Now that I've detailed routing and component props in SvelteKit, I can
explain how the `load` function is used.

If I wanted to load some data for the about page, I could create a
`+page.ts` file alongside the `+page.svelte` file in the `/about`
folder.

```bash
touch src/routes/about/+page.ts
```

Now there's an associated `+page.ts` file for the `+page.svelte` file:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ +page.svelte
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ +page.ts
â””â”€â”€ +page.svelte
```

This is a contrived example, but say in that file, if I want to get
some data (from an external source later) I can use the SvelteKit
`load` function that will return that data to be used in the
`+page.svelte` file.

I'll make a simplified example for now and just return an object with
a title property in the `src/routes/about/+page.ts` file:

```ts
export const load = () => {
	return {
		title: 'This data is from the load function',
	}
}
```

In SvelteKit, the `+page.svelte` file is a Svelte component, so it can
also receive props. The `data` prop is reserved in SvelteKit routes to
receive the data from a `load` function.

In the `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` file, I can receive the `data`
prop and use it in the page.

I can just log out the data into a `<pre>` tag for now to see the
data:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<h1>This is the about page</h1>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

Then I can use the data in the page and access the `title` property:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<h1>This is the about page</h1>

<p>{data.title}</p>
```

So, yes, a super simple example which I hope help illustrate how the
`load` function works in SvelteKit.

## Go deeper, practical examples

Ok, now onto some practical examples of using the `load` function.

So the most common use case for the `load` function is to fetch data
from an external source, like an API. I'll be using two APIs in the
following examples, the [Coinlore API] (REST) and the [Rick and
Morty API] (GraphQL).

In the following sections I'll go through various examples of fetching
data from an API on the server and client.

## Fetching page data, client

Ok, I'll start with fetching the top 100 cryptocurrencies from the
[Coinlore API] on the client.

I'll use the index route for this, so I'll add in a `+page.ts` file
for the index route:

```bash
touch src/routes/+page.ts
```

My `/routes` folder now looks like this:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ +page.svelte
â”œâ”€â”€ +page.svelte
â””â”€â”€ +page.ts
```

In the `+page.ts` file, I'll create a `load` function, destructure the
SvelteKit `fetch` and create a response variable to store the data.

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const response = await fetch(
		'https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/',
	)
	const currencies = await response.json()
	return currencies
}
```

This example doesn't have any error handling, I'll add in some simple
error handling:

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	try {
		const response = await fetch(
			'https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/',
		)
		if (!response.ok) {
			throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`)
		}
		const currencies = await response.json()
		return { currencies }
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error)
		return { error: 'Unable to fetch currencies' }
	}
}
```

The return value of the `load` function is the data that will be
available in the `+page.svelte` file as the `data` prop.

In the `+page.svelte` file, I'll receive the `data` prop and use it in
the page. I'll just log out the data into a `<pre>` tag for now to see
the data:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

That gives me an output similar to this on the page:

```json
{
	"currencies": {
		"data": [
			{
				"id": "90",
				"symbol": "BTC",
				"name": "Bitcoin",
				"nameid": "bitcoin",
				"rank": 1
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Now I've validated the data is being fetched from the API, I can
iterate over the data and render it on the page with a Svelte each.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<h1>Top 100 Cryptocurrencies</h1>

<ul>
	{#each data.currencies.data as coin}
		<li>{coin.name}</li>
	{/each}
</ul>
```

Now, say I have data from another API I want to fetch on the client.
I'll use the [Rick and Morty API] in the next example along with the Coinlore
API.

## Fetching page data from multiple sources

I'll show an example of how I'd get the data from the Rick and Morty
API now, this is appending headers to the `fetch` function along with
a post method on the request and returning stringified JSON data.

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const query = `query AllCharacters {
    characters {
      results {
        name
        id
        image
      }
    }
  }`

	try {
		const response = await fetch(
			'https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/',
			{
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				},
				body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
			},
		)

		if (!response.ok) {
			throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`)
		}

		const { data } = await response.json()
		return { characters: data.characters.results }
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error)
		return { error: 'Unable to fetch characters' }
	}
}
```

Notice that I'm returning `characters` from the
`data.characters.results` results here, it cleans up the data returned
to the `+page.svelte` file.

Also note that I'm not using a client like `graphql-request` to make
the request, I'm using the `fetch` function from SvelteKit.

So, now I can combine the data from the Coinlore API and the Rick and
Morty API.

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const query = `query AllCharacters {
    characters {
      results {
        name
        id
        image
      }
    }
  }`

	try {
		const response = await fetch(
			'https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/',
			{
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				},
				body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
			},
		)

		if (!response.ok) {
			throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`)
		}

		const { data } = await response.json()

		const fetchCoins = async () => {
			const response = await fetch(
				'https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/',
			)
			const { data } = await response.json()
			return data
		}

		const currencies = await fetchCoins()

		return { characters: data.characters.results, currencies }
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error)
		return { error: 'Unable to fetch data' }
	}
}
```

There's one issue with this approach, this is causing a waterfall
where the Coinlore API request is only made after the Rick and Morty
API request.

If I check the network tab in the browser I can see the calls are
being made one after the other:

[![sveltekit-data-loading-understanding-the-load-function-waterfall]]
[sveltekit-data-loading-understanding-the-load-function-waterfall]

To avoid that I can wrap both the API calls in their own functions and
the promise from each will be resolved at the same time:

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const query = `query AllCharacters {
    characters {
      results {
        name
        id
        image
      }
    }
  }`

	try {
		const fetchCharacters = async () => {
			const res = await fetch(
				'https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/',
				{
					method: 'POST',
					headers: {
						'Content-Type': 'application/json',
					},
					body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
				},
			)

			if (!res.ok) {
				throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${res.status}`)
			}

			const { data } = await res.json()
			return data.characters.results
		}

		const fetchCoins = async () => {
			const response = await fetch(
				'https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/',
			)

			if (!response.ok) {
				throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`)
			}
			const { data } = await response.json()
			return data
		}

		return {
			characters: fetchCharacters(),
			currencies: fetchCoins(),
		}
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error)
		return { error: 'Unable to fetch data' }
	}
}
```

Alternatively I can use a `Promise.all` to resolve both promises:

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const query = `query AllCharacters {
    characters {
      results {
        name
        id
        image
      }
    }
  }`

	try {
		const [charactersResponse, currenciesResponse] =
			await Promise.all([
				fetch('https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/', {
					method: 'POST',
					headers: {
						'Content-Type': 'application/json',
					},
					body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
				}),
				fetch('https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/'),
			])

		if (!charactersResponse.ok) {
			throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${charactersResponse.status}`)
		}

		if (!currenciesResponse.ok) {
			throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${currenciesResponse.status}`)
		}

		const charactersData = await charactersResponse.json()
		const currenciesData = await currenciesResponse.json()

		const characters = charactersData.data.characters.results
		const currencies = currenciesData.data

		return { characters, currencies }
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error)
		return { error: 'Unable to fetch data' }
	}
}
```

Now if I take a look at the network tab in the browser, I can see that
both requests are made in parallel:

[![sveltekit-data-loading-understanding-the-load-function-parallel]]
[sveltekit-data-loading-understanding-the-load-function-parallel]

Aight, now I'll take a look at how to fetch data on the server.

## Fetching page data, server

Neither of the APIs I'm using require authentication, so I can fetch
data from them on the server.

The previous examples I've shown you are fetching data on the client
and the server.

If I add a console log to the `load` function, I can see that it's
being called on the server (I see the console log in the terminal) and
on the client (I see the console log in the browser).

If I have an API that requires authentication, I can fetch data on the
server and pass it to the client.

I'll need a `+page.server.ts` file, this indicates that the `load`
function should only be called on the server.

```bash
touch src/routes/+page.server.ts
```

Although this is a contrived example I'll create a `.env` file to hold
some environment variables that can be used in the `load` function.

I'll create the file via the terminal:

```bash
touch .env
echo "PUBLIC_TOKEN=this is a public token" >> .env
echo "SECRET_TOKEN=this is the secret token" >> .env
```

<Banner options={env_info} />

I'll replace the code in the `+page.ts` file with the following, which
will import the secret environment variable and log it to the console
then fetch the data from the Coinlore API.

I'll add the same code to the `+page.server.ts` file:

```ts
import { SECRET_TOKEN } from '$env/static/private'

export const load = async () => {
	console.log('=====================')
	console.log(SECRET_TOKEN)
	console.log('=====================')
	const fetchCoins = async () => {
		const req = await fetch('https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/')
		const { data } = await req.json()
		return data
	}

	return {
		currenciesServer: fetchCoins(),
	}
}
```

If I try to run this code in the `+page.ts` file I'll get an error
warning me that I can't use `$env/static/private` in a client-side
file.

In the `+page.ts` file I'll remove the `$env/static/private` reference
and re-label the return value to `currenciesClient`:

```ts
export const load = async () => {
	const fetchCoins = async () => {
		const req = await fetch('https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/')
		const { data } = await req.json()
		return data
	}

	return {
		currenciesClient: fetchCoins(),
	}
}
```

Now, running the dev server I can see that the secret token is logged
to the console in the terminal but not in the browser.

**But wait!** Remember this is a contrived example, but, getting
client side data and server side will be a common task.

I'm now getting the Coinlore data on the browser and the client,
right?

In the `+page.svelte` file dump out the contents of the `data` prop
being passed to the page from the `load` function:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

Going to the browser on `localhost` to check the JSON output I can see
that I have a `currenciesClient` property but not one for
`currenciesServer`...

If I comment out the `load` function in the `+page.ts` file then I get
the `currenciesServer` property in the JSON output, but not the
`currenciesClient` property.

If I have a `load` function in both a `+page.ts` and a
`+page.server.ts` and I want that data to be available on the client
I'll need to merge the two objects together.

In the `+page.ts` file I can pass in the `+page.server.ts` `data` prop
and merge it with the `+page.ts` `data`:

```ts
export const load = async ({ data }) => {
	const fetchCoins = async () => {
		const req = await fetch('https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/')
		const { data } = await req.json()
		return data
	}

	return {
		...data,
		currenciesClient: fetchCoins(),
	}
}
```

Going to the browser now to check the JSON output I can see that I
have a `currenciesClient` and `currenciesServer` in the output.

## Fetching layout data, client

Ok, so, now I'm hoping you have a good understanding of how the `+`
files work for fetching data.

For this example it's the same setup as the previous example, but I'll
create a `+layout.ts` file to fetch data on the client.

```bash
touch src/routes/+layout.ts
```

I'll delete the `+page.server.ts` file and rename the return from the
`+page.ts` file back to `currencies`:

```ts
export const load = async () => {
	const fetchCoins = async () => {
		const req = await fetch('https://api.coinlore.com/api/tickers/')
		const { data } = await req.json()
		return data
	}

	return {
		currencies: fetchCoins(),
	}
}
```

Now, I have the following files in the `src/routes` directory:

```text
src/routes
â”œâ”€â”€ +layout.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ +page.svelte
â””â”€â”€ +page.ts
```

In the `+layout.ts` file I'll add a load function to get all the
characters from the Rick and Morty API:

```ts
export const load = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const reqCharacters = await fetch(
		'https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql/',
		{
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify({
				query: `
          query AllCharacters {
            characters {
              results {
                name
                id
                image
              }
            }
          }
      `,
			}),
		},
	)
	const {
		data: {
			characters: { results },
		},
	} = await reqCharacters.json()

	return {
		characters: results,
	}
}
```

Data from layouts in SvelteKit is available to all child
`+page.svelte` routes.

In the `src/routes/+page.svelte` file I'll add a `<pre>` tag to dump
out the `data` prop:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

In the index page I have access to the Coinlore data from the
`+page.ts` and also the Rick and Morty data.

If I create another route, for example, `/about`, I'll have access to
the characters data. I'll validate that now by creating a new
`+page.svelte` file in a `src/routes/about` directory:

```bash
mkdir src/routes/about
touch src/routes/about/+page.svelte
```

Then in the `about` route add a `<pre>` tag to the `+page.svelte` file
to dump out the `data` prop the same way I did for the index page:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let data
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

In the about page I only have access to the `characters` data provided
by the `+layout.ts` file.

## Fetching layout data, server

For fetching layout data on the server it's the same exercise as with
the `+page.server.ts` file.

I'll rename the `+layout.ts` file to `+layout.server.ts`.

```bash
mv src/routes/+layout.ts src/routes/+layout.server.ts
```

Add in a console log to the `+layout.server.ts` file much like in the
`+page.server.ts` file, then I can see the console log in the terminal
but not on the browser console.

If I visit the `/about` page I can see the data is being passed to the
`src/routes/about/+page.svelte` file.

Going back to the index page I get the Coinlore data along with the
Rick and Morty data.

## Conclusion

In this post I've covered the basics of SvelteKit, including routing,
component props, and the `load` function.

I've also covered how to fetch data from external sources on the
client and server.

I hope this post has helped you get started understanding how to load
data with SvelteKit.
