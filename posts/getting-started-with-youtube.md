I started adding videos to [my YouTube channel] in November 2018, this
was mainly intended as an accompaniment to the blog post I did to [Get
your GraphCMS data into Gatsby].

A the time I was using a web cam I'd bought off of Amazon for around
£17, the quality wasn't great but it helped me get my point across.

I used my [Transformer Pro] with [OBS] then went on and uploaded it to
YouTube and embedded the video into the blog post.

This isn't a post on how to grow your audience, I'm still working on
that myself! Although I will recommend the [Developer's Guide to
Starting a YouTube Channel] (affiliate link) a great book by James Q
Quick on the subject, which has loads of great actionable content.

## Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this because I was asked by a friend of mine (Rich Haines)
his words "You should do a guide on getting started with YouTube
vids." he also said it's something he's considered but didn't know
where to start.

> It's something I've thought about but don't really know the process.

Rich asked me to cover a few points, some of them I can give what I
know, other areas are still a WIP for me.

These are the bullets, I'll be digging into these a bit more but for
simplicities sake I have literally copy pasted them from the
conversation I had with Rich:

- [How to get started](#how-to-get-started)
- [What do I need](#what-do-i-need)
- [How do I set it up](#how-do-i-set-it-up)
- [Editing](#editing)
- [Marketing](#marketing)

At this point in time I have got 80 videos on YouTube, I'm at the
start pretty much.

Like with most of the content I write, I'm making this for people one
or a couple of steps behind me but ultimately for future me.

## Disclaimer

This is my opinionated guide, the tools and approaches I use may not
work for you. My primary OS now for making content is Windows
([powered by WSL]) I used Linux in the past but the experience was a
bit too rough around the edges to justify using it.

## How to get started

<!-- cSpell:ignore jfdi,mkbhd -->

In the words of Joel Hooks, JFDI, this is the same advice you will
hear from a lot of YouTubers when someone asks "How to be a YouTuber?"
they'll say, start, iterate, get better.

In the words of MKBHD

> You'll never start off with a perfect first video.

<!-- cSpell:ignore 4l8eeqgCJnQ -->

<YouTube youTubeId="4l8eeqgCJnQ" skipTo={{
    h: 0,
    m: 6,
    s: 18,
  }} />

What you also need to bear in mind is that MKBHD has also been
consistently adding videos to YouTube since [2009].

Here's some sage advice from Twitter motivator Danny Thompson.

<Tweet tweetLink="DThompsonDev/status/1315087467733815297" />

Also from Rich himself when feeling particularly insightful.

<Tweet tweetLink="studio_hungry/status/1314940921100865538" />

They both covey the same message.

## What do I need

As this is my opinionated guide I'll be detailing what I use for the
content I'm producing (mainly coding guides).

The basics you would need would be:

- a computer
- a mic
- screen capture software

Here's my list of tools I use for recording videos, nothing that's
going to break the bank but not incredibly cheap either.

<!-- cSpell:ignore Fifine,aukey -->

- [Fifine USB Mic], at £24.99 when I purchased it in 2018, it's now
  around £50.
- [OBS]: Free and open source.
- [Aukey Webcam], at £45 there are other options of comparable quality
  I've got a couple sub £20 which were terrible.
- [XSplit VCam], best bit of software I've paid for recently. I got a licence
  for a quarter (at £9.95) and will be getting a lifetime licence (at £49.99)
  when it's time to renew.
- [USB Lighting], this clips to the desk and adds a little additional lighting,
  at £9.09 it'll do for now.
- [Large Microphone Boom Arm], not essential but is can cut vibrations
  from the desk (when typing) if the mic is on the desk.

The sound will be the most important thing when people are watching
your video so a decent mic will go a _long_ way, I'm still really
happy with the quality of my Fifine USB mic I got back in 2018.

For screen recording all I have ever used is OBS on Windows, Linux and
macOS so I'm not able to recommend anything outside of that. Doing the
standard **"screen recording software"** search brings up loads of
options for free and paid software.

There is also Streamlabs OBS which has a lot of pre-made scenes and
integration with YouTube and Twitch.

Streamlabs OBS is all together a much nice looking experience but I
found it a bit tedious digging around for settings.

Streamlabs OBS is a fork of OBS so if there are any improvements in
OBS they may take a while to be implemented in Streamlabs OBS.

## How do I set it up

I'm going to presume this is "how do I set up the screen recording
software?" so in my case this is "how do I set up OBS?"

When you first open OBS after downloading it you're prompted to use
the Auto-Configuration Wizard which will determine the best settings
based on your hardware and internet speed.

![obs-auto-configuration-wizard]

There are two options, if you're not interested in streaming on Twitch
then I'd suggest selecting the second option. The last option is for
sharing your scenes with other software like Zoom.

[Open Broadcaster Software] (OBS) is a whole post in itself I think!

For the very basics you're going to need a scene with a display
capture.

The bottom left corner will show you the Scenes collection, this is
where you can create differing appearances of how the screen appears
when you make a recording.

![empty-starting-scene]

You can right click on the Scene name and select Rename from the
context menu to give it a more meaningful name if you wish.

First thing that will need to be added to the Scene is a display to
record. In the Sources panel (next to Scenes) click the plus button
and select Display Capture, the next dialogue will prompt you to
select a screen to display in the scene.

![add-display-capture.png]

Check the video here on setting up your first OBS Scene:

<YouTube youTubeId="hSgI0z9E3tA" />

### Scenes

Now that I've gone over the basics of a scene there's a few I use for
when I'm doing a screen recording, there's a few more for streaming.

For doing a screencap for a guide which is going to be a pre-recorded
YouTube video I'll use a scene with my desktop input source and
sometimes with a video capture device.

In this scenario I'll rarely switch scenes and stick with the scene I
start with.

If I'm streaming there's a couple I'd use, first would be same if it
were a pre-record with a desktop input source and a video capture
device.

#### Be Right Back!

If you're streaming and you're not able to stay on the camera, like
when that delivery you've been waiting on all day decides to turn up
and knock on your door ten minutes into a stream!

This would be a good candidate for a **Be Right Back** Scene, this
(for me) is an image I created in PowerPoint with BRB on there.

#### Countdown Timer

If you're streaming and want to have a countdown timer, there's a
script you can use in OBS available for download in the [OBS
forum resources section] which is pretty neat, download that for use later.

To use it you'll need to add Text (GDI+) to the scene, in the text
Create/Select Source give the text a name and select ok.

![add-text-to-scene]

In the text properties dialogue that pops up add in some placeholder
text so you're able to identify where on the Scene the text is.

There are other options in the text properties dialogue to give the
text the appearance you like.

Next up select Tools > Scripts from the OBS menu. Click on the plus
button and add the script download from the [OBS forum resources section].

![add-script]

Here you can add in the duration and the start and stop text. You'll
also need to add the Text Source as the Text (GDI+) source you added,
type the name you gave the text source in here.

See the video here for a walkthrough of setting it up:

<YouTube youTubeId="rUHy_tBzXus" />

### Lighting

Lighting is something I didn't worry about too much when I first
started but now that the days are drawing in and there's less natural
light available a little extra light goes a long way!

The images in this tweet were taken early in the morning with no
available natural light, the little USB light is angled away from my
face towards the wall behind my monitor.

<Tweet tweetLink="spences10/status/1315169567199694849" />

This little lamp is enough for me right now as that's all I have room
for really, your situation may be different.

### Sound

Sound is one major factor in videos, if is sounds like crap no one
wants to hang around.

OBS has some great options for this and in the latest version (26.0.2)
there's been some awesome additions.

Prior to that I had issues sometimes with background hiss on my mic
and I had a noise gate filter, this would be when you spoke and you
voice was over a certain level then the mic opened reducing the
background noise.

With the latest OBS version there's an option for Noise Suppression
which resolved most of the issues I was having, adding a little extra
gain goes a long way too.

To add filters to your mic input click on the cog nex to where the mic
level is moving and select Filters fom the context menu.

From here add in the desired filters, ones I have are Noise
Suppression, Compressor, Gain and Noise Gate.

They are all at the default setting except for gain which is at
10.00dB. These setting will vary with differing microphones so my
setting will probably not match what result you want from your set up.

Check out the short video detailing adding filters to your mic input.

## Editing

Editing, whats that then? 😂

Seriously, time is a factor for me when recording videos, I'm super
limited on the amount of time I can take. I've found it simpler to do
a one take than spend time editing videos.

I have had comments both for and against the unedited approach, in
some cases, where I've made a typo and it's taken a while to realise
the mistake that time is enough to turn people away from the video or
compel them enough to leave a comment.

Comments are great as it's engagement for the video that wouldn't be
there otherwise. But it's not great to have to sit through it as a
viewer.

On the odd occasion that I have used video editing it would be to
remove something mid video on an otherwise useful video.

Video editing software I'd recommend that I have used personally would
be [OpenShot] and [Shotcut], both open source and cross platform.

<!-- cSpell:ignore uhms -->

Shotcut is my go to at the moment, it's really handy for removing all
the uhms and errs from a video.

## Marketing

I can't help you, sorry!

Marketing is something I really don't have anything salient to share
other than the usual clichés like content is king or about being
authentic 🤷‍♀️. Not much help I know, really hand-wavy advice and
something I'm not really happy about saying.

I'll leave it there with that one!

## What about YouTube tho?!!

So, if you've got this far then THANK YOU 🙏, I really appreciate it.

If you're looking to start adding videos to YouTube, what do you need
other than the video?

If you don't have a Google account already set up then you will need
to [Create a new Google account].

If you already have a google account but want to create a new YouTube
channel check out the [YouTube channel switcher] which gives you the
option to create a new channel. You will be walked through the process
of creating a new channel.

Adding a video to YouTube is straightforward enough, from your YouTube
page there should be a plus icon that looks like a movie camera:

![youtube-add-icon]

Click on this to be taken to your [YouTube studio] here is where you can
add your beautifully crafted video for the world to see.

You'll be prompted to add a title and a description for the thumbnail
you can select a slide from the video as the thumbnail or add a custom
one of your choosing.

With the revision of the age limits on YouTube there's a section for
if it's for kids or not. I have it defaulted to "No, it's not made for
kids".

There's an option to add video elements I personally haven't used this
option but there is a lot of information on this in the Google support
pages for this.

Last section will be for visibility, you can set this to private or
public, the default is unlisted, this means that anyone with a link
can view it otherwise it's not publicly accessible. Once the video is
finished uploading you can set this to public. There's also an option
to schedule the release date.

Done! Your video will be available on YouTube.

## Wrap up!

That's it that's pretty much all the things I know. You should be able
to do the following now:

- Get set up with OBS
- Use OBS to create basic scenes
- Create a countdown timer OBS scene
- Remove background noise from you mic with filters
- Add a video to YouTube via the YouTube studio.

Thanks again 👍
