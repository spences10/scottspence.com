This is basically a rant about the job market, I was laid off back in
August, this is a terrible time of year to be looking for work,
everyone is on holiday so things are generally pretty slow so when
this happened to me I did the same and went on holiday for the end of
August and first week of September. Coming back from holiday I found
that things were still pretty slow with the occasional phone call
about roles that were not really suited to my skill set. It was at
this point that I began to struggle and stress about ever being
employed again.

## No one wants to hire you

![stress-office]

For the longest time I thought there was something wrong with my CV so
I read up on [ATS'] and added what I thought was needed to at least
meet the minimum requirements for passing the ATS if there was one for
the roles I was applying for.

What I have also found is that my skill set is now in a minority,
that's not to say that banks are going to stop using Excel overnight
but it does mean that there are other technologies being used here,
Visual Studio Tools for Office and Excel DNA mean that there are .NET
controls that can be used in little old Excel which a lot of
organisations want now.

This has basically brought me to the conclusion that I should be
expanding my skill set, so I have been busy getting the skills I need
to become a full stack web developer using the awesome free course
material at [freeCodeCamp] (fCC) I'm still in the very early stages of
this and am not about to start looking for full stack web developer
jobs but it is something that I'm going to commit a lot of my spare
time to so I can build a portfolio to showcase my skills for
prospective employers. This will be an additional tool to my toolkit
I'm also hoping to gain a lot of insight into general purpose
programming languages, something currently lacking from my 'skill
stack'.

What I found whilst searching for roles is that someone with VBA, SQL
and C# there is also the need now for Tableau, ClikView or some other
data visualisation software which stands to reason that now we have
all this data that we should actually be able to gain some insight
from it, this is something I'll be looking into with the scripting
language Python (general purpose programming language) once I have
progressed with my FCC certification.

## Lessons learned

Things I have learned, most of the time the job doesn't exist (lead
generation) If it does exist and you match one of the skills on the
spec you will have every recruiter in the country [and abroad] calling
you for the role. Wild salary ranges £40k-£80k that's a pretty big range,
these ads usually come with every skill imaginable so it's safe to say
that they don't really know what they want or the role doesn't really exist.

## Recruiters

![shady-recruiter-middle-man]

So this is where we get all warm and fuzzy talking about recruiters
and what great jobs they do. How they are always busy talking to
hiring managers for many different roles and juggling multiple
candidates.

I have worked in the past in the same office as recruiters and
understand what they do for a job, and the time and effort needed to
find good candidates.

#### What the recruiter says:

> hi Scott, just seen your profile and think you will be a really good
> match for a role I'm recruiting for

#### What it actually means:

> you have come up in my keyword search and I'm blindly calling you, I
> haven't really read your profile

This was incredibly frustrating experience for me, yes I could have
done things better and like I said this was basically a rant, this is
so people can relate, **BUT!**

Gone are the days of carefully crafted covering letters and tailoring
your CV for that specific job, most of the time your CV doesn't even
get seen by a human and is instead rejected by an ATS.

If we all went back to the days of trust and real relationships with
recruiters that we trusted and had met and that understood our needs
would they have the role we needed?

Just because we have an understanding with a few recruiters doesn't
mean that they have the perfect role waiting for us when we start
looking for work, although you will be at the top of their list if
they do get that role.

What I like and respect in a recruiter is if I can get five minutes
into a phone conversation with a recruiter that has actually read my
profile or my CV.

What I found with recruiters is first a ten minute conversation asking
me how I'm finding the market and then asking me what my ideal next
role would be.

This is basically their due diligence, what they should have
determined by looking at your profile before calling you.

After this it goes one of two ways, the recruiter then being honest
with you [in some cases] and telling you they actually don't think you
are suitable for the role (which they could have done if they took the
time to read your profile) let's just bear in mind ten minutes before
it was,

> Hi Scott, just seen your profile on LinkedIn and I'm really keen to
> talk to you about a role with one of our very high profile clients
> I'm recruiting for.

The call usually ends with a "I'll send the spec through for you to
look at let me know what you think" and the mail never turns up or the
old chestnuts "I'll pass you details on to my colleague" and "I'll
update your details on our database"

this far thank you for persevering, if you can relate I'd be keen to
hear your story.
