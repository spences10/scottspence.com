From scratch to Create React App on Windows

**An opinionated guide on setting up a web development environment on
Windows 10**

I have been a professional web developer for 10 months now and used
both macOS and Windows in that time. My preferred OS to use is
Windows, for no other reason than I prefer the keyboard layout.

With Windows/Linux I like to have my Ctrl key as the key to use for
copy paste operations and I can use my left pinky instead of my thumb.
Anyway, let's leave the weak reasoning behind as that's not the
purpose of this post!

If you don't have a Windows machine then this post probably isn't for
you, if this is different from what you use, it doesn't make it bad.

Let's see what Ken has to say about it:

https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler/status/1075556283795824640

This is the refresh on [my guide from the start of 2018] on setting up
a web development environment on a Windows machine.

This guide will cover installing Ubuntu but you can use some of the
other flavours of Linux available in the Windows store, the Debian
setup will be very similar to the Ubuntu one.

## Objective of this post

To go from a fresh instance of Windows 10 to something you can develop
web apps with.

These instructions are for the **Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and
later.**

## Install WSL

You can install Ubuntu from [the Microsoft store] which will be the
first half of the install the second will be when you open the app.

## Enable WSL on your machine

The [official guidance] covers it very well, but I'm going to add in the
shortcut keys here if you don't want to be clicking around with the mouse.

Before that however, if you haven't selected PowerShell as your
default Command Prompt you can select it from the Taskbar settings
page located in the Personalisation section in the Settings, I suggest
doing that now:

![powershell activation]

Whilst we're at it we should also enable hidden folders and add files
extensions for known file types in Windows File Explorer.

Open the Windows File Explorer with Windows key+e then select View
from the ribbon. Then click the Options button on the far right, this
will bring up the Folder Options dialogue, from here we want to select
the View tab and select the Radio button for Hidden files and folders
with the 'Show hidden files, folders and drives', uncheck the option
for 'Hide extensions for known file types' too. Click apply and Ok.

The reason we're doing this is so that we can see the `.git` folder in
project structures it's also needed for files like `.env` files which
are used for environment configuration.

![show file extensions]

<!-- cSpell:ignore dmin -->

Use Windows key+x, this is the same as right-clicking the windows icon
on the desktop, this will open the quick link menu. From here you need
to select the Windows PowerShell (<u>A</u>dmin) option, you can do
this by pressing **a** on the keyboard. So Windows key+x then a, will
open the user account control (Admin) prompt, presuming you have admin
rights on your machine you'll need to click yes to continue.

Copy the code here and paste it into the PowerShell window, Ctrl+v
will work in PowerShell, press enter to execute the command.

```bash
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

You will be prompted to restart your machine after this, which you
should do.

> Check the link for a complete list of [windows keyboard shortcuts].

After restarting you can open the Ubuntu program from the start menu
and the second install (of WSL on your system) should happen. Wait for
this to complete then you will be prompted to create a user and a
password for the account. You will need to remember the password
created for the user as you will be prompted for it to use `sudo`
privileges.

## update, upgrade and autoremove

At the time of writing this, the version I have linked of Ubuntu is
18.04.1

The linked app will install the latest stable Ubuntu release on
Windows.

You can check what version of Ubuntu you have installed with:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

!e]

If you want to use a specific LTS version of Ubuntu you can get them
from the Windows Store, here:

- [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS]
- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS]

Now we're going to go ahead an update and upgrade all the things, the
three commands here will update and upgrade all the pre-installed
software that comes with the Ubuntu install.

The code below is three commands joined together with `&&`. The `-y`
flag is to auto accept the changes that are going to be performed with
the upgrades. Auto remove will remove unused packages left behind from
upgrades.

Copy the below commands into your Ubuntu terminal, and run the
command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
```

> To go from 16.04 to 18.04 try `do-release-upgrade` in the terminal.
> be warned this takes considerably longer than just deleting the
> current install of Ubuntu and starting again.

Now that the base has been installed and updated we need to install
the [build-essential] package in order to compile and build other
packages, the following packages we're going to install will all need
it.

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential
```

From here on in I'd suggest using two bash windows, one with sudo
enabled the other with standard permissions.

> i.e. open a terminal and don't enter `sudo` in there, instead use
> the terminal that has been granted that permission.

The reason for this is that I have found if you install node as sudo
then each time you want to run an `npm install` command you will need
to grant sudo permissions and it can all get a bit tedious. And you
really shouldn't be installing npm packages with sudo permissions.

## Install Node (with `n`)

Let's get our run-time on! If you use Node.js you will eventually have
situations where you need to be able to switch Node versions, for this
you may have heard to nvm ([Node Version Manager]) which by the way
you can still use in WSL.

The reason for me opting for n over nvm is that in the past I
experienced slow bash startup times whilst using nvm. Take a look at
this [WSL GitHub issue detailing it] and the specific comment for the
[pros of using n].

Ok let's install n, with [n-install], the command doesn't start with
sudo so use it in the bash window you have with no sudo privileges.üßê

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
```

This will install the latest version of Node for us, follow the prompt
on the terminal screen to reload bash:

```bash
# mine looks like this
. /home/scott/.bashrc
```

Now check the versions of Node and npm we have installed with
`node -v && npm -v` in the terminal.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Install VS Code? What? This post is to set up WSL? Ok, so we're going
to presume that this is going from nothing to being able to web dev,
so we're going to need a text editor, and there's nothing out there at
the moment that comes close to VS Code, if you already have a text
editor installed then skip to the next part.

Install the Windows version of VS Code from the [Download section] once
installed we can enable WSL in the settings, the quickest way to do this
is to open the integrated terminal in VS Code with the shortcut keys Ctrl+'
üëà that's and apostrophe. You will be prompted to select your default terminal,
select WSL Bash.

![vscode config]

## Install Windows Git

There's a bit of stumbling block getting [Git support for VS Code],
it's well documented in the various issues mentioned in the linked
issue.

There are workarounds as well with things like [WSLGit] which has it's
own set of issues, this all stems from users (me included) not wanting
to have to install another binary for Git.

I have tried several variants when it comes to using Git with VS Code
and the path of least resistance was biting the bullet and installing
that additional binary, there's an overhead with having to maintain
and configure SSH keys for both Windows and WSL Git but it's a one
time setup.

Until the VS Code team incorporate [WSLGit] into VS Code I think this
is the best option.

Install from [git-scm.com] the link will start downloading the install
binary you can then open it and go through the install, you can keep
clicking next through the install, I have selected a few options that
I would like enabled.

![windows git setup]

For now, that is all we need to do, when it comes to authenticating
with with GitHub using SSH we will use the Git Bash command line to
configure the Windows side of things.

## Install a Terminal (Hyper)

Now we have bash on Windows it's time to install a nice Terminal app,
because, let's face it, the standard one is a bit basic.

Enter [Hyper] an electron based terminal app that is super themeable
and configurable.

Download and install hyper for Windows, this will be the bare-bones
version, it'll look something like this:

![basic hyper]

You may notice that, this is the Windows Command prompt too, don't
worry, we're going to configure that right now.

Open up the `.hyper.js` file located in the root of your user folder,
or from Hyper itself use the shortcut key Ctrl+, to pop open the
settings.

If the settings file (`.hyper.js`) opens in Notepad then you can set
the default to be VS Code. In File Explorer (Use Windows key+e to open
it) navigate to the file, it'll be in your User folder, right-click
the file and select Properties, then Change for 'Opens with:' and
select VS Code from the list.

![default-file-type]

Now we can set WSL as the shell path in Hyper, open the `.hyper.js`
settings file and search (Ctrl+f) for bash, we want to add the path to
the WSL shell into the `shell` property defined in the file.

```js
// amend shell path
// WSL Bash
shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe',
```

We can also change the appearance of Hyper from here by specifying
font size and font family and also predefined themes, let's quickly
add in the `hyper-adventure-time` theme into the plugins section.

Open another Hyper tab with Ctrl+Shift+t, this will show the bash
terminal for WSL now.

![hyper config]

Quick orientation with the Hyper terminal keyboard shortcuts:

- New tab = Ctrl+Shift+t
- Close current tab = Ctrl+Shift+w
- Cycle through tabs right = Ctrl+Shift+right arrow
- Cycle through tabs left = Ctrl+Shift+left arrow

Now I'm going to configure some additional properties for Hyper, and
change the theme to something a bit more subtle.

<!-- cSpell:ignore fira -->

I purchased Dank Mono, if you want a similar font as OSS check out
[FiraCode].

Here's what I changed:

```js
module.exports = {
	config: {
		fontSize: 18,
		fontFamily: '"Dank Mono",...',
		cursorShape: 'BEAM',
		cursorBlink: true,
		copyOnSelect: true,
		plugins: ['hyper-altair'],
	},
}
```

![final hyper config]

## Install Fish Shell!

Ok, time to install the Fish Shell! This is a completely optional
step, I like to use fish for the nice intellisense you get when
navigating file structures, there are also some neat themes you can
get with Oh My Fish

```bash
sudo apt -y install fish
```

![install fish]

### Install Oh My Fish

Now we can install Oh My Fish (OMF) and get a nice terminal theme
going on too, remember we talked about running commands with the
correct permissions? Well this is one of those occasions, open a new
tab first then paste in the following:

```bash
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```

![install omf]

#### Fish themes with OMF

After installing OMF you can pick a theme, here you may notice that
the text doesn't fit in the screen on Hyper, a quick way to reset it
is to maximise the window then back again, I did this with the Windows
key+arrow up to maximise the Windows key+arrow down to restore it.

<!-- cSpell:ignore agnoster -->

After installing omf I chose the theme agnoster, installed with
`omf install agnoster` you can list out what is available and what you
have already installed by selecting `omf theme` let's change it once
more to the `one` theme, adjust the size of the window first as things
are getting a bit cramped.

![omf one]

Have a play around there's loads there, I prefer the one theme because
you can see what version of node you're running on, over on the far
right. Here you can also see the intellisense for fish where it shows
agnoster as a previous selection, if I wanted to select agnoster I
could tab to complete the rest of the command.

## Configure

So, now we have a swanky looking new terminal and a bare-bones VS Code
install it's time to get things moving.

I have a [cheat-sheets] repo detailing a lot of the configuration
we're about to go through here, if you find something useful along the
way please drop a PR with the suggestion.

First up, in place of typing out `fish` each time I open a new
terminal, and not replacing bash which you can do, but I prefer to use
an alias. So what we're going to do is open up the `.bashrc` file and
edit it.

From a new terminal type in `nano ~/.bashrc`, nano is a bash text
editor. Scroll (or Page) down to the bottom of the file and add in an
alias for fish, `alias f=fish` then to exit nano Ctrl+x and confirm
changes with a `y`. Reload the `.bashrc` file like we did after using
n to install Node `. /home/scott/.bashrc` but your username in place
of mine üòÑ, now we can use f instead of fish! Well done you saved
yourself typing three extra characters!!!.

![alias fish in .bashrc]

## Git config

Before we crack on with spinning up a Create React App instance we're
going to need to configure Git, via the `.gitconfig` file.

We're going to use nano to add some settings for Git, both in WSL and
Windows, this is the extra config I mentioned earlier, apologies!

First up we'll config our bash environment then move onto Git bash on
Windows.

```bash
# open up the .gitconfig file in WSL bash
# nano will create one if it doesn't exist
nano ~/.gitconfig
```

It's nearly identical config for both environments apart from Windows
uses the credential `manager` helper and WSL will need the `cache`
helper.

```bash
# needed in Git Bash for Windows
[credential]
  helper = manager
# needed in WSL
[credential]
  helper = cache
[color]
  ui = true

[user]
  name = yourGitHubUserName
  email = yourGitHub@email.com

[core]
  editor = code --wait
```

Make your changes then Ctrl+x to exit and confirm with y, that's the
first part of the Git config done.

In Git Bash for Windows do the same in the terminal, use nano to
create a `.gitconfig` file and add the setting to it.

## Create React App

Ok, we shall get create react app going so we can get Git configured
with GitHub using SSH and start making changes to commit to a GitHub
repo.

We're going to use [npx] to make a starter React project with Create
React App. If you want to have your projects somewhere else now is the
time to navigate to that directory.

From the terminal enter:

```bash
# this will create a starter react project
# called create-react-app
npx create-react-app create-react-app
```

This is creating the project in my home (`~`) folder, I've had to
speed the gif up to 20x faster, it does take a while.üôÉ

<!-- cSpell:ignore Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee -->

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

![npx cra]

So, now that we have spun up a React app to work on we should make a
change and then add it to GitHub.

Navigate to the create-react-app folder in the terminal and open the
project. You can open VS Code with the `code .` command, the `.`
denotes the current folder in the terminal.

This will open VS Code at the root of the create-react-app project,
make sure everything is working as expected by running the start
script in npm.

```bash
npm run start
```

If you want to see what scripts are available in the current project
you can also use `npm run` which will list defined npm commands from
the `package.json` file.

A window will open displaying the basic Create React App landing page,
we're going to add a h1 to the `App.js` module then commit it, via the
Source Control menu in VS Code.

> Please bear in mind this is an up and running guide for a
> development environment, I'm not going to be detailing developing in
> React

Whilst the terminal is busy starting up the create-react-page we can
open another tab in Hyper with Ctrl+Shift+t and open up VS Code with
the `code .` command, navigate to the `App.js` component and add a
`<h1>` tag to it just above the `<img>` tag with
`<h1>Hello React!</h1>` in it.

Now the landing page should show the newly added h1, we can confirm
that the file is changed in Git by doing a `git status` from the
terminal. Then we can commit it from either the terminal or the IDE
(VS Code) my preference is to use VS Code as the visual diffing of
files is great.

Commit the changes with Ctrl+Enter if you have not selected the file
you want to commit you wil get a dialogue telling you there are no
staged changes to commit, you can select the files (in this case only
the `App.js` file) by clicking the plus next to the file. Hitting
Ctrl+Enter again will commit the changes with a message, you can check
that there are no changes to commit with `git status` from the
terminal or visually from the Source Control section in VS Code.

![cra change]

Ok, time to add our super sweet code changes to a repository on GitHub
for the world to see!

Next up we're going to go through adding the local changes we've made
to a GitHub repository. If you haven't got a GitHub account and are
following along now may be a good time to set one up.

## Use SSH with GitHub

First up, we're going to make a repository on GitHub and push the
changes we have made to it, here we're going to click the + button in
the top right of the GitHub home page, enter a repository name and
GitHub will give you some defaults to choose from. As we have already
made change locally we can ignore the first several commands but we do
need the command to add the remote:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:spences10/cra.git
```

And to push the changes up to GitHub `git push -u origin master` but
we're going to get an error, as we haven't set up SSH.

![make repo]

### WSL SSH Config

Open a new bash tab in Hyper and enter `ls -al ~/.ssh` check that
there are no `rsa` files before doing this.

> You'll notice that we're doing this in bash rather than Fish.

If there's nothing there then generate new keys with:

```bash
# add your email address üëç
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C yourGitHub@email.com
```

Now `ls -al ~/.ssh` will show two additional files:

```bash
# there should be a private and public key-pair
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
```

Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add RSA key to SSH with:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Now time to add the public SSH key to GitHub, in WSL were going to
copy pasta the public SSH key with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in Hyper
then we can copy from Hyper to a [new SSH key].

Finally authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

![ssh config wsl]

### Windows Git Bash SSH Config

For Windows Git Bash we're going to copy our SSH keys we've just
generated in WSL over to Windows Git Bash, there are some subtle
differences when authenticating with Windows Git Bash.

From Hyper, copy the SSH files from Linux to Windows:

<!-- cSpell:ignore spenc -->

```bash
cp ~/.ssh/* /c/Users/spenc/.ssh/
```

Start the SSH agent:

```bash
eval `ssh-agent -s`
```

Add the key to SSH agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Authenticate:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

![ssh config win]

Now the additional set up for SSH is done we should be able to go back
to Hyper and push our change to GitHub.

![final push github]

Also you may have noticed that the SSH Key üîë token went from black to
green on the settings screen there this indicates that you have
authenticated.

## Change WSL version

If you want to use a different version of Ubuntu, Debian or any of the
other available distributions of Linux from the Windows store with
Hyper you will need to change the default version from PowerShell:

<!-- cSpell:ignore wslconfig,setdefault -->

```bash
# list available versions
wslconfig /l
# set default
wslconfig /setdefault Debian
```

## Wrap up!

That's it! We have gone from scratch to a functioning web development
environment. There are several other personal things I'm now going to
add to my install now which is aliases for both Git and Fish shell. If
you are interested in them I have a [cheat-sheet for Fish] with a list
of all my aliases I use, the same for my `.gitconfig` you can find
that in my [dotfiles] repo
