I've written about this [in the past] and more recently how I've
turned what can seem like a massive drain on your resources it [into a
dev project].

These are my opinions but ones that I know are shared by the rest of
the tech community as a whole.

## Phantom jobs

Ever see roles advertised with wild swings in pay "£50k-£80k for the
right candidate"?

> Often employers advertise jobs that don’t exist, hoping to find
> people who might be useful later on or in a different context.

## Hiring in tech is hard

But it doesn't have to be, there are so many companies that swear by a
technical test. The reasoning "how else are we able to determine a
candidates skill level?"

This post is mainly in response to some people seeing an increasing
amount unreasonable requests for the take home project.

## The take home test

## Time to fill the position

You give each candidate a test that is specified not to take longer
than 3 hours, you have a shortlist of 6 candidates (that's 18 hours of
throw away work)

The expectation (for the employer) is that the candidate has nothing
better to do with their time and that this is the one and only focus
in their life.

The reality is that the candidate is interviewing with 3-6 other
places. Imagine if each prospective employer asked the candidate to do
a take home test.

So, this take home test will go to the bottom of the pile whilst they
tackle the other assignments.

How long do you think it will take the candidate to get round to your
specific test that is going to find you the perfect candidate?

## Respect peoples time

Like I said; hiring is hard but there needs to be some effort put in
by the employer.

> "We advertised for a role at 08:00 on Monday and by 14:00 had 600
> CVs to work through!"

Slight exaggeration I'm sure but I see this a lot from employers

## Do the groundwork

1. Make a shortlist.
1. Validate the candidates credentials. They should have a presence on
   at least one of GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.
1. Do they have a blog or write on any other platform dev.to, Hashnode
   or Medium.
1. Reach out to them

Opinions on take home tests, I have them, so do other people!

Excerpts from Tweets [1], [2]:

I know hiring is hard from both sides. If you ask a candidate to do a
minimum 5-8 hour technical take home assignment then there shouldn't
be a need for a probationary period. Sound fair (for the employer)? Of
course not

If you hire someone just by talking to them and reviewing the code
they already have made available (Git, example projects) and it
doesn't work out then that's what a probationary period is for. Sound
fair?

It's all about risk aversion, but a lot of the burden for this is on
the candidate.

I wouldn't mind doing live coding in an interview, there's obviously
pressure in that too and some people can't do it. With take home tests
(more often than not) the company think that you're only interviewing
with them and you've got nothing better to do with your spare time.

I live coded for my current role and it went really badly, but the
team lead was able to see my thought process and how I worked through
things. A take home test doesn't demonstrate that and looking at the
code afterwards the reviewer isn't going to know that.

This again puts all the pressure on the candidate, leaving it open
ended like that means that "it's up to you how much you want this
role" How much time will the reviewer spend looking at it? Will you
get feedback? 😂

I've witnessed candidates get rejected for using tabs instead of
spaces before. It's bonkers, instead of looking for reasons not to
hire, make the right candidate choices FIRST before investing any
time.
