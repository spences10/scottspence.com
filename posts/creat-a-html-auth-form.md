I was asked to create a simple auth from at work, this tweet
immediately sprang to mind.

<!-- cSpell:ignore bubu -->

<Tweet tweetLink={`KiddBubu/status/1187120868259979269`} />

<!-- ![like a psychopath tweet](./like-a-psychopath.png) -->

All it needed to do was hit and endpoint and redirect to a link.

## Scaffold out the form

## Style

## JavaScript

## Thanks for reading 🙏

That's all folks! If there is anything I have missed, or if there is a
better way to do something then please let me know.
