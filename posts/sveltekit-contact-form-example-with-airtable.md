This is a how-to guide for adding a contact form to your SvelteKit
site using Airtable to store the submissions and notify you when there
is a new submission.

This is an update to the [previous post] I did on this, the recent changes
to how you create access keys in the Airtable API means that I get a chance
to revisit this and make it a little more current.

It will detail making a submission using an event handler and a
default form action. Both of these examples will use built-in form
validation on the client only.

After those examples I'll go into setting up a similar example using
SvelteKit Superforms which has client and server validation with
[Zod].

The previous post goes over creating a new SvelteKit project and
setting up the Airtable base, for the sake of completeness I'll go
over that again here.

## How forms are handled in SvelteKit

Because SvelteKit builds on top of the standard [Web APIs] there's not
a great deal of difference in how you handle forms in SvelteKit over standard
HTML form submissions.

Collect data on the client &rArr; submit to the server &rArr; process
the data &rArr; send a response back to the client.

Each of the examples in this post will be following this approach.

## Create a new SvelteKit project

To create the example project I'll scaffold out a new SvelteKit
project using the `pnpm create` command:

```bash
pnpm create svelte sveltekit-and-airtable-contact-form-example
```

I'll be picking the following options from the `create-svelte` CLI:

```text
create-svelte version 4.1.0

┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◆  Which Svelte app template?
│  Skeleton project
│
◆  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
│
◆  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
│  ◼ Add ESLint for code linting
│  ◼ Add Prettier for code formatting
│  ◼ Add Playwright for browser testing
│  ◼ Add Vitest for unit testing
└
```

Then I'll need to create the routes for the examples, `action`,
`event-handler`, and `super-forms`. I'll create the folders and files
for these now along with the `submit-form` endpoint, I'll do these via
bash, if you're following along create the files how you like:

```bash
mkdir src/routes/{action,event-handler,submit-form,super-forms}
```

With the folders created I'll add in the files I need for each route:

```bash
touch src/routes/action/{+page.server.ts,+page.svelte}
touch src/routes/event-handler/+page.svelte
touch src/routes/submit-form/+server.ts
touch src/routes/super-forms/{+page.server.ts,+page.svelte}
```

Now I 've got the files in place for the project I'll focus on getting
the Airtable base set up.

## Create an Airtable base

If you're new to Airtable you can [sign up for a free account] and go through
the onboarding process which will ask you some questions to get set up
with a new base.

I want a base that will store the submission from the contact form, I
have an Airtable account already so I'll create a new base from the
dashboard.

Here's what the base I created looks like. If you're following along
take note of the case of the table field names as they will need to
match the code examples:

- base name: `contact-requests`
- table name: `submissions`
- table fields: `name`, `email`, `message`
- table field types: `single line text`, `email`, `long text`

## Create Airtable API key

To be able to write data via the Airtable API I'll create a [Personal
access token] with the following scopes and access to the
`contact-requests` base:

**Scopes**

- `data.records:read` See the data in records
- `data.records:write` Create, edit, and delete records
- `schema.bases:read` See the structure of a base, like table names or
  field types

**Access**

- `contact-requests`

I'll click the 'Create token' button and copy the token value to the
clipboard.

For reference, this is what I have for the scopes and access on
Airtable:

[![airtable-create-personal-access-token]]
[airtable-create-personal-access-token]

I'll need to save the generated token into a `.env` file. I can create
a new file for that with the following command:

```bash
touch .env
echo "AIRTABLE_API_KEY=" >> .env
echo "AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=" >> .env
```

I'll add the generated `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` value to the `.env` file
there's also the `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` value that I'll need to add to the
`.env` file, I can get that from the Airtable API docs.

The Airtable base ID is detailed in the API docs for the project. The
quickest way to get there is to click on the 'Help' link in the top
right of the Airtable dashboard and then scroll down to the end of the
panel that pops out and click on the 'API documentation' link under
the 'Additional resources' section.

This opens up documentation specific to the base I'm working with. The
ID for the base is detailed in the introduction section of the docs
with the line:

**The ID of this base is appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.**

I'll copy the ID value and add it to the `.env` file for the
`AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`.

The Airtable API docs also detail how I can 'Create records' using the
API with curl and JavaScript examples. I'll be using these to make the
SvelteKit endpoint in the next section.

## Create API endpoint

Aight, now I'll scaffold out a SvelteKit `POST` endpoint to handle the
form submission. I've already got the `+server.ts` file I created
earlier in the `src/routes/submit-form` folder.

I'm going to base the code off of the Airtable `curl` example which
looks like this:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.airtable.com/v0/appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/submissions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
  "records": [
    {
      "fields": {
        "name": "Dave Davidson",
        "email": "medaveyo@iamhim.com",
        "message": "Yo yo yo!"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

Really, all I need from this is the shape of the data being submitted
which I'll put into a variable like this:

```ts
let data = {
	records: [
		{
			fields: {
				name,
				email,
				message,
			},
		},
	],
}
```

So in my endpoint I need to make a `POST` request to the Airtable API
using the `fetch` API. I'll need to add the `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and
`AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` values from the `.env` file to the request headers
using the SvelteKit `$env` module and I'm going to want to return a
message if it fails or succeeds.

```ts
import {
	AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
	AIRTABLE_BASE_ID,
} from '$env/static/private'
import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const POST = async ({ request }) => {
	const { name, email, message } = await request.json()

	const AIRTABLE_URL = `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/submissions`

	let data = {
		records: [
			{
				fields: {
					name,
					email,
					message,
				},
			},
		],
	}
	const res = await fetch(AIRTABLE_URL, {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}`,
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify(data),
	})

	if (res.ok) {
		return json({
			message: 'success',
		})
	} else {
		return json({
			message: 'failed',
			status: 404,
		})
	}
}
```

Ok, now I've got the endpoint set up I can test it out. I'll go with
the event handler approach first.

## With an event handler

In the previous post I did this, I used an event handler to handle the
form submission. I'll use the same approach here.

The input names will need to match the field names in the Airtable
base. I'll add the `name` attribute to the input elements in the from
as well.

I'll create a `handle_submit` function that will be called when the
form is submitted. I'll use the `preventDefault` modifier to prevent
the default form submission behaviour and then I'll get the form data
and pass that onto the `submit-form` endpoint via `fetch` request.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	const handle_submit = async (event: Event) => {
		submission_status = 'submitting'

		const form = event.target as HTMLFormElement
		const form_data = new FormData(form)
		const data = Object.fromEntries(form_data)

		const res = await fetch('/submit-form', {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		})

		const { message } = await res.json()
	}
</script>

<h2>Event handler</h2>

<form method="POST" on:submit|preventDefault={handle_submit}>
	<label for="name">
		<span>Name</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="text"
		name="name"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Enter your name"
		required
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<label for="email">
		<span>Email</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="email"
		name="email"
		aria-label="email"
		placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
		required
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<label for="message">
		<span>Message</span>
	</label>
	<textarea
		name="message"
		aria-label="message"
		placeholder="Message"
		required
		rows="3"
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit to Airtable" />
</form>
```

The message response form the endpoint can them be used for some
conditional rendering of the form.

I'll create a `submission_status` variable and set it to the response
form the endpoint. Then I can use some Svelte if blocks to render
different content depending on the status.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let submission_status = ''
	const handle_submit = async (event: Event) => {
		submission_status = 'submitting'

		const form = event.target as HTMLFormElement
		const form_data = new FormData(form)
		const data = Object.fromEntries(form_data)

		const res = await fetch('/submit-form', {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		})

		const { message } = await res.json()
		submission_status = message
	}
</script>

<h2>Event handler</h2>

{#if submission_status === 'submitting'}
	<p>Submitting...</p>
{:else if submission_status === 'failed'}
	<p>Submission failed.</p>
{:else if submission_status === 'success'}
	<p>Submission success.</p>
{:else}
	<form method="POST" on:submit|preventDefault={handle_submit}>
		<label for="name">
			<span>Name</span>
		</label>
		<input
			type="text"
			name="name"
			aria-label="name"
			placeholder="Enter your name"
			required
			autocomplete="off"
		/>
		<label for="email">
			<span>Email</span>
		</label>
		<input
			type="email"
			name="email"
			aria-label="email"
			placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
			required
			autocomplete="off"
		/>
		<label for="message">
			<span>Message</span>
		</label>
		<textarea
			name="message"
			aria-label="message"
			placeholder="Message"
			required
			rows="3"
			autocomplete="off"
		/>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit to Airtable" />
	</form>
{/if}
```

Using the `submission_status` variable I can render different content
depending on the status of the submission.

## With an action

Since the last post form 'actions' were implemented into SvelteKit.
Actions are a way to post data from a form to a server using the
`<form>` element.

This means that JavaScript is not required to handle the form
submission in the browser and instead uses the default `POST` method.

The form can be submitted to the server from the client (browser).

In the `+page.server.ts` file I created for the `action` folder I'll
add a `default` action to an `actions` object.

In it I'm destructuring `request` and `fetch`, I can use the `request`
object to get the form data and then use `fetch` to send the data to
the `submit-form` endpoint.

```ts
export const actions = {
	default: async ({ request, fetch }) => {
		const formData = await request.formData()
		const data = Object.fromEntries(formData)
		const res = await fetch('/submit-form', {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		})
		const responseJson = await res.json()
		return {
			body: responseJson,
		}
	},
}
```

In the `+page.svelte` file I'll use the same markup for the name,
email and message fields as before.

In the form method, again I'll use `POST` and that's it. The form will
be submitted to the `submit-form` endpoint via the default action in
the `+page.server.ts` file.

```svelte
<h2>Action</h2>

<form method="POST">
	<label for="name">
		<span>Name</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="text"
		name="name"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Enter your name"
		required
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<label for="email">
		<span>Email</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="email"
		name="email"
		aria-label="email"
		placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
		required
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<label for="message">
		<span>Message</span>
	</label>
	<textarea
		name="message"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Message"
		required
		rows="3"
		autocomplete="off"
	/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit to Airtable" />
</form>
```

Ok... so, what about getting some information back from the server?

Much like the `data` prop that pages can use, they can also accept a
`form` prop. You may have noticed the `body: responseJson` return in
the `default` action in the `+page.server.ts` file.

This is the response from the `submit-form` endpoint, it's the same
response as the `fetch` call in the `handle_submit` function in the
`+page.svelte` file. I can get the `message` from the response and use
it again in the page to do some conditional rendering.

So at the top of the `+page.svelte` file I'll add a `form` prop to the
page component. As I'm using TypeScript I can add a type to the prop
as well.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import type { ActionData } from './$types'

	export let form: ActionData

	$: submission_status = form?.body?.message
</script>
```

This isn't strictly necessary though as SvelteKit will infer the type,
so I can just use this:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let form

	$: submission_status = form?.body?.message
</script>
```

This is what the full `+page.svelte` file looks like:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms'

	export let form

	$: submission_status = form?.body?.message
</script>

<div>
	<h2>Action</h2>

	{#if submission_status === 'submitting'}
		<p>Submitting...</p>
	{:else if submission_status === 'failed'}
		<p>Submission failed.</p>
	{:else if submission_status === 'success'}
		<p>Submission success.</p>
	{:else}
		<form method="POST" use:enhance>
			<label for="name">
				<span>Name</span>
			</label>
			<input
				type="text"
				name="name"
				aria-label="name"
				placeholder="Enter your name"
				required
				autocomplete="off"
			/>
			<label for="email">
				<span>Email</span>
			</label>
			<input
				type="email"
				name="email"
				aria-label="email"
				placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
				required
				autocomplete="off"
			/>
			<label for="message">
				<span>Message</span>
			</label>
			<textarea
				name="message"
				aria-label="message"
				placeholder="Message"
				required
				rows="3"
				autocomplete="off"
			/>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit to Airtable" />
		</form>
	{/if}
</div>
```

You might also have noticed the `use:enhance` in the form element.
This is so the page doesn't refresh when the form is submitted.

## SvelteKit Superforms

A late addition to this post is the use of SvelteKit Superforms.

All of the validation in the prior examples was done using the built
in HTML attributes for the form validation. This is fine for simple
forms but it can get a bit messy when you have more complex forms.

Superforms is a package that allows you to create forms with
validation via Zod on both the client and the server.

I'll save a lot of the walkthrough for another post but I'll show you
how to use it with the form we've been working with.

So, I'll need to install SvelteKit Superforms and Zod as dependencies.

```bash
pnpm i -D sveltekit-superforms zod
```

Then in my `super-forms` folder where the `+page.server.ts` and
`+page.svelte` files are I can define the validation schema (with Zod)
and the default form action.

The `load` function is going to return the form object wrapped in the
`superValidate` function. This will validate the form data and return
the form object with the validation results.

```ts
import {
	AIRTABLE_BASE_ID,
	AIRTABLE_API_KEY,
} from '$env/static/private'
import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { superValidate } from 'sveltekit-superforms/server'
import { z } from 'zod'

const new_contact = z.object({
	name: z.string(),
	email: z.string().email(),
	message: z.string(),
})

export const load = async event => {
	const form = await superValidate(event, new_contact)
	return {
		form,
	}
}

export const actions = {
	default: async event => {
		const form = await superValidate(event, new_contact)
		if (!form.valid) fail(400, { form })

		const { name, email, message } = form.data

		const AIRTABLE_URL = `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/submissions`

		let data = {
			records: [
				{
					fields: {
						name,
						email,
						message,
					},
				},
			],
		}
		await fetch(AIRTABLE_URL, {
			method: 'POST',
			headers: {
				Authorization: `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}`,
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		})

		return {
			form,
		}
	},
}
```

Now in the `+page.svelte` file I can import the `superForm` function
and destructure out the `form`, `errors` and `enhance` functions which
can also be used to validate the form on the client.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { superForm } from 'sveltekit-superforms/client'
	import SuperDebug from 'sveltekit-superforms/client/SuperDebug.svelte'
	import { z } from 'zod'

	export let data

	let submission_status = ''

	const new_contact = z.object({
		name: z.string().min(2),
		email: z.string().email(),
		message: z.string().min(10),
	})

	const { form, errors, enhance } = superForm(data.form, {
		validators: new_contact,
		resetForm: true,
		onSubmit: event => {
			submission_status = 'submitting'
		},
		onUpdated: ({ form }) => {
			if (form.valid) {
				submission_status = 'success'
			}
			submission_status = ''
		},
		delayMs: 500,
	})
</script>

<div class="mx-auto max-w-xl">
	<h2>Super form</h2>

	{#if submission_status === 'submitting'}
		<p>Submitting...</p>
	{:else if submission_status === 'failed'}
		<p>Submission failed.</p>
	{:else if submission_status === 'success'}
		<p>Submission success.</p>
	{:else}
		<form method="POST" use:enhance>
			<label for="name" class="label">
				<span class="label-text">Name</span>
			</label>
			<input
				bind:value={$form.name}
				data-invalid={$errors.name}
				type="text"
				name="name"
				aria-label="name"
				placeholder="Enter your name"
				required
				autocomplete="off"
				class="input input-bordered w-full {$errors.name
					? 'input-error'
					: ''}"
			/>
			<label for="name" class="label">
				<span
					class="label-text-alt {$errors.name
						? 'text-error'
						: 'text-base-100'}"
				>
					{$errors.name}
				</span>
			</label>

			<label for="email" class="label">
				<span class="label-text">Email</span>
			</label>
			<input
				bind:value={$form.email}
				type="email"
				name="email"
				aria-label="email"
				placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
				required
				autocomplete="off"
				class="input input-bordered w-full {$errors.email
					? 'input-error'
					: ''}"
			/>
			<label for="email" class="label">
				<span
					class="label-text-alt {$errors.email
						? 'text-error'
						: 'text-base-100'}"
				>
					{$errors.email}
				</span>
			</label>

			<label for="message" class="label">
				<span class="label-text">Message</span>
			</label>
			<textarea
				bind:value={$form.message}
				name="message"
				aria-label="message"
				placeholder="Message"
				required
				rows="3"
				autocomplete="off"
				class="textarea input-bordered w-full {$errors.message
					? 'input-error'
					: ''}"
			/>
			<label for="message" class="label">
				<span
					class="label-text-alt {$errors.message
						? 'text-error'
						: 'text-base-100'}"
				>
					{$errors.message}
				</span>
			</label>

			<input
				type="submit"
				value="Submit to Airtable"
				class="btn btn-primary mt-10 w-full"
			/>
		</form>
	{/if}
</div>
```

You can see that I'm using a lot of conditional styling with Tailwind
if there are errors or not. This is a really nice way to give the user
some feedback on what they need to do to get the form to submit.

This is my initial attempt at using Superforms! There's probably
issues with this example and I'll be taking some more time to fully go
through the SvelteKit Superforms [docs] so I'm not missing out on any
of the features it provides.

## Airtable automation

Airtable can send you a notification email when there's a new record
added to the table (base) this means that you're not having to check
the table for new records.

To do that there's an automations button in the top left of the Base,
click that to open the automations panel.

Down on the bottom of the automations panel there's a button to create
a new automation, click that.

Then click on the `+` button to add a new trigger, select 'When record
is created', then a properties panel will open on the right.

For the configuration select the 'submissions' table, you can test the
automation now by choosing a record from the table.

In the middle section of the automation panel you can click on 'Add
advanced logic or action' and select 'Send an email' from the list.

Over in the properties panel on the right you can configure the email
to send, you can add in the email you want the notifications sent to
with a standard subject line.

In the message section of the properties panel you can choose what
data you want included in the email by clicking the `+` in the top
right of the input field.

I've picked the name, email and message fields to be included in the
email. You can add in and additional message you want to be included.

Once all the fields are configured you can click the 'Generate a
preview' button at the bottom of the page to see what the email will
look like.

If you're happy with the automation and want to use it don't forget to
toggle it on in the top left of the center panel.

## Conclusion

I went through the process of creating a contact form with SvelteKit
and used Airtable to store the form submissions.

I created an endpoint to submit the data to Airtable on the server
then demonstrated how to submit the data with an event handler, a
SvelteKit form action and with Superforms.

I hope you can take this information and start implementing your own
contact forms on your projects.

If you're interested, you can check out the example code for this post
over on GitHub [sveltekit-and-airtable-contact-form-example].
