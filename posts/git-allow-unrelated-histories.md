How to combine two separate unrelated Git repositories into one with
single history timeline.

Just adding a quick note on thisâ€¦

I had a project that started off as it's own project but it ended up
needing to go into an already existing project, so I thought ok add it
as a new branch on the existing project with `git remote add origin`
then push the changes up to the origin then all is well with the
world. That was until I tried to compare the branchesâ€¦

There isn't anything to compare? Bit misleading there as there is but
the commit histories are different. How do you get around it, well the
first Google result was a bit sparse with the details but then I found
this which was more helpful. I needed to merge the disparate branches
which is now disabled by default in git but can be enabled with the
--allow-unrelated-histories flag.

```bash
git merge origin use-ts-bot --allow-unrelated-histories
```

This brought up, understandably, a few conflicts with the branch I
wanted to merge with the origin.

```bash
Auto-merging package.json
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in package.json
Auto-merging package-lock.json
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in package-lock.json
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
Auto-merging .gitignore
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in .gitignore
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

To get around this I just took the latest version of the `use-ts-bot`
branch from my GitHub account and then and used that in place of the
`origin` conflicts as what I'm working on will ultimately replace the
master branch, so it was just a copy pasta into my VS Code then
recommit the changes files. Phew! I now have a branch I can compare
with the master that I will one day make a PR for ðŸ˜…
