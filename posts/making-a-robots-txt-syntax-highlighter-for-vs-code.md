I was asking ChatGPT to read some posts from my site and summarise
them for me, I was a bit surprised when I got the response **"I wasn't
able to directly access the URL you provided due to restrictions on
the webpage."** from the bot. It was then that I recalled that I'd
blocked ChatGPT in the `robots.txt` file on my site. üòÖ

I've had all sorts of stuff added to that file over the years, and to
be honest, this is the only time I've known for sure that it works! üòÇ

Anyway, real quick, if you don't want ChatGPT crawling your site, add
this to your `robots.txt` file:

```text
# Specific directives for GPTBot
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
```

So, that's fine, right, but I wanted to add some syntax highlighting
to the file in VS Code. I had a quick look on the marketplace, and
there's nothing there that did that one thing, so, I made one. üòÅ

Yes, this is a post about me making a my `robots.txt` file look nice
in my editor, and the way I went about it.

## I have previous!

If you check out my [publisher profile] on the Visual Studio Marketplace
you'll see that I have done this sort of thing before. Not for a while
though!

So, <DD date="2017-02-27" /> ago was the last time I made a VS Code
extension, and I've not done anything similar since.

This is serving as a record for future me on the things I did and
helpful to anyone else doing something similar.

## Install dependencies

So there's `yo` ([yeoman.io](https://yeoman.io)) which is a
scaffolding tool that essentially generates the files and folders,
then there's the `generator-code` specifically for generating VS Code
extensions.

```bash
pnpm install -g yo generator-code
```

In summary, `yo` is the tool that manages the scaffolding process, and
`generator-code` is the specific template for scaffolding out VS Code
extensions.

With them installed I can now generate the extension.

## Generate the extension

Put the two together installed dependencies together an you get
`yo code` which will ask you a bunch of questions about the extension
I just went through these as a best guess, I can change them later if
needed.

```bash
yo code

     _-----_     ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
    |       |    ‚îÇ   Welcome to the Visual  ‚îÇ
    |--(o)--|    ‚îÇ   Studio Code Extension  ‚îÇ
   `---------¬¥   ‚îÇ        generator!        ‚îÇ
    ( _¬¥U`_ )    ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ
    /___A___\   /
     |  ~  |
   __'.___.'__
 ¬¥   `  |¬∞ ¬¥ Y `
```

Rather than leave the output from the generator in the text output
I'll add the questions to a list here:

- **? What type of extension do you want to create?**
  - I picked **New Language Support**
- **Enter the URL (http, https) or the file path of the tmLanguage
  grammar or press ENTER to start with a new grammar**.
  - I left this empty, but later it was auto generated [and
    pointed here].
- **? URL or file to import, or none for new:**
  - Left empty
- **? What's the name of your extension?**
  - robots.txt syntax highlighting
- **? What's the identifier of your extension?**
  - robots-txt-syntax-highlighting
- **? What's the description of your extension?**
  - Syntax highlighting for robots.txt files
- **? Language id:**
  - robots-txt, this means that that language can be selected in VS
    Code
- **? Language name:**
  - robots.txt
- **? File extensions:**
  - .txt
- **? Scope names:**
  - Left empty
- **? Initialize a git repository?**
  - Yes

Now, that was a lot of scary and confusing questions! üòÖ I've created
a `robots-txt` language? Well, yeah, but only for use in the
extension.

Now the project is made for me and I can open it in VS Code.

The project structure looks like this:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscode
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ launch.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ syntaxes
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ robots-txt.tmLanguage.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitattributes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscodeignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ language-configuration.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vsc-extension-quickstart.md
```

## Project structure

I'll go through each file and my understanding of what it does.

**`.vscode/launch.json`**

```json
// A launch configuration that launches the extension inside a new window
// Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
// Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
// For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Extension",
			"type": "extensionHost",
			"request": "launch",
			"args": ["--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"]
		}
	]
}
```

This is the configuration for launching the extension in a new window
so I can test out the extension is working as expected, I can hit F5
to launch the extension in a new window.

I left it as is.

**`syntaxes/robots-txt.tmLanguage.json`**

This is the grammar for the language, I'll be wanting to match things
in the `patterns` section that are specific to a `robots.txt` file.

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinring/tmlanguage/master/tmlanguage.json",
	"name": "robots.txt",
	"patterns": [
		{
			"include": "#keywords"
		},
		{
			"include": "#strings"
		}
	],
	"repository": {
		"keywords": {
			"patterns": [
				{
					"name": "keyword.control.robots-txt",
					"match": "\\b(if|while|for|return)\\b"
				}
			]
		},
		"strings": {
			"name": "string.quoted.double.robots-txt",
			"begin": "\"",
			"end": "\"",
			"patterns": [
				{
					"name": "constant.character.escape.robots-txt",
					"match": "\\\\."
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"scopeName": ""
}
```

This got switched out with this:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinring/tmlanguage/master/tmlanguage.json",
	"name": "robots.txt",
	"fileTypes": ["txt"],
	"firstLineMatch": "^User-agent:",
	"patterns": [
		{
			"match": "^(User-agent|Disallow|Allow|Sitemap|Host):(\\s*)(.*)",
			"captures": {
				"1": {
					"name": "keyword.control.robots-txt"
				},
				"3": {
					"name": "string.unquoted.robots-txt"
				}
			}
		},
		{
			"match": "#.*",
			"name": "comment.line.number-sign.robots-txt"
		}
	],
	"scopeName": "source.robots-txt"
}
```

The `match` pattern is updated to capture three distinct groups:

1. The keyword (`User-agent`, `Disallow`, `Allow`, `Sitemap`, `Host`)
1. Any whitespace characters (`\\s\*`)
1. The remainder of the line (`.\*`)

As I don't want to capture the whitespace, I've not assigned it a
scope. (i.e. that's why it goes from 1 to 3)

So, using the captures property, I can then assign different scopes to
each captured group. Group `1` is assigned the
`keyword.control.robots-txt` scope, and group `3` is assigned the
`string.unquoted.robots-txt` scope.

**`language-configuration.json`**

This is the configuration for the language, as there's not much to the
`robots.txt` language the majority of this will be stripped out.

```json
{
	"comments": {
		// symbol used for single line comment. Remove this entry if your language does not support line comments
		"lineComment": "//",
		// symbols used for start and end a block comment. Remove this entry if your language does not support block comments
		"blockComment": ["/*", "*/"]
	},
	// symbols used as brackets
	"brackets": [
		["{", "}"],
		["[", "]"],
		["(", ")"]
	],
	// symbols that are auto closed when typing
	"autoClosingPairs": [
		["{", "}"],
		["[", "]"],
		["(", ")"],
		["\"", "\""],
		["'", "'"]
	],
	// symbols that can be used to surround a selection
	"surroundingPairs": [
		["{", "}"],
		["[", "]"],
		["(", ")"],
		["\"", "\""],
		["'", "'"]
	]
}
```

Here's what I replaced it with:

```json
{
	"comments": {
		"lineComment": "#"
	},
	"brackets": [],
	"autoClosingPairs": [],
	"surroundingPairs": [],
	"folding": {
		"markers": {
			"start": "^User-agent:",
			"end": "^\\s*$"
		}
	},
	"indentationRules": {
		"increaseIndentPattern": "^User-agent:",
		"decreaseIndentPattern": "^\\s*$"
	}
}
```

I added in the `folding` and `indentationRules` properties to enable
folding and indentation and added the `lineComment` property to
specify the comment character.

## Install VSCE

I'll need to install the [Visual Studio Code Extension Manager] so I
can package and publish the extension.

```bash
pnpm i -g @vscode/vsce
```

## Package the extension

Now I can package and publish the extension.

I'll set the package version with `npm`

```bash
npm version patch # major 1.0.0 | minor 0.1.0 | patch 0.0.1
```

This will increment the version in `package.json` and create a git
tag.

Once I'm done I can push the tag to GitHub:

```bash
git push --tags
```

Then I can package the extension:

```bash
vsce package
```

This will create a file called `robots-txt-0.0.1.vsix` this is what's
going to go to the marketplace.

## Test the extension

I can test the extension by hitting F5 in the project that will bring
up the extension in a sandboxed environment where I can check the
highlighting is to my expectation.

## Publish the extension

Now I'm happy with the extension I can publish it to the marketplace.

```bash
vsce publish
```

Now I get a prompt for a personal access token:

```bash
vsce publish
 WARNING  Failed to open credential store. Falling back to storing secrets clear-text in: /home/scott/.vsce
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/
Personal Access Token for publisher 'spences10':
```

I already have a marketplace account so, I'll need to create that
token now!

## Create a personal access token

To get my access token created, I'll go here:
https://spences10.visualstudio.com/_details/security/tokens

> Change your username if your doing this yourself.

I'll navigate through [the notes on working with extensions] on the VS
Code documentation to create the token. The steps are:

- Name: whatever (I'll set the token to expire a day later)
- Organisation: my organisation (or whatever yours is)
- Scopes: Custom defined
- Click show all scopes, select:
  - Marketplace
    - Check Acquire and Manage
- Create

Copypasta the token into the prompt and hit enter.

Done! üéâ

## Conclusion

In a nice little tangent, I set about a minor yet intriguing project
to beautify the `robots.txt` file in my VS Code editor.

This serves as a note to future Scott but, I hope you found it useful
too! üí´
