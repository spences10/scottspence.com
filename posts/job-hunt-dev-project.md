Cliffs/TL;DR

I made a [recruiter FAQ] on my personal site for recruiters and
created an [online CV].

## Preamble

<!-- cSpell:ignore ranty,behbeh -->

Apologies up front about this post if it comes across as entitled or
ranty and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with my approach.

I'm going to try my hardest to not get too cynical here, so, first up
let's get this out there to start with. I think technical recruitment
is in a very bad state! It has been for a long while (since 2010 at
the very least).

Starting out on a job hunt and getting your CV out there will generate
a lot of calls where the most irrelevant keyword on your CV will
generate unwanted calls from what at times appear to be desperate
recruiters.

> Urgent position to fill: Team Lead, 6+ year experience - immediate
> start £900 a day, 3 month contract.

Ok, that's a bit harsh! it's the truth, Ruth! It all sounds a bit
cliché now as well.

Being a developer I began to notice patterns with each call I got, the
same questions kept getting asked over and over. Also as a developer I
want to keep things [DRY] to save myself (and the recruiter) a bit of
time.

So to this end I decided to add an [FAQ] section to my personal
portfolio, this was a list of all the questions I had been asked on
the many calls previously, so, rather than have the recruiter have me
on the phone for ten minutes just to qualify me for the role they
could do the _vast_ majority of that with the provided [FAQ], almost
like a reverse job spec, all they have to do is READ the [FAQ]! Then
check off my wants and needs from the list I have already provided.

For some reason though, a lot of recruiters would insist on talking to
me, taking time out of my day, they'd then proceed to ask the same
questions every other recruiter would ask. This would qualify them to
me as someone that didn't value my time and they'd lose any
credibility they may have had with me.

So, I made a site, a portfolio, that listed all you could want to know
about me. I added the About, which covers my back-story and coding
history, how I got into it and where I am now. There's also a Now
section and a Uses section. They are what I'm doing now, in my life
ans the things I use, like code editor and hardware.

The pages of the portfolio are all in markdown generated by Gatsby, so
when there was a question asked that was not on the list I could add
it quickly. Using Netlify made this even simpler, because it was a Git
push and the changes would be live in minutes,

Making a site, this is more for prospective employers rather than
recruiters and although the majority of recruiters will talk to you as
though they are the ones considering you for the role they're only the
first stage in what can be a quite lengthy process.

So, let's forget about recruiters for now and concentrate on the one
main thing you need to get out there if you're looking for a job, your
CV.

Making a [CV], I went to the effort to make a basic site using my
favourite tech stack **[teh JAMStack behbeh!]** I used the
[JSONresume] tool to detail all the roles I had held then used the
JSONresume as a guide for how I should make the individual components
for the [CV].

If you want to get started with your own JSON Resume you can run the
npm command `npx resume-cli init` to kick-start your own.

Feel free to [use my CV] as a template for your own as well, all you
need to do is generate your CV and push it to now.sh.

This was my full employment history and quite long and as I was
looking for a job in a new field the vast majority of it was not
pertinent to a my job search, this is why I decided rather than blast
out my [CV] everywhere I'd post out the list of answers to the
questions recruiters always asked me when calling me. So rather than
have them crawl through my mostly irrelevant job history they could
get the answers to the questions they wanted answering. The [CV] was
there if they wanted more detail on me, all they had to do was READ!

In my mind the [personal portfolio] and the [CV] site were a good
indication of my current skill level with styling and preferred stack,
in reality no one cares as long as it looks nice and recruiters even
less so because it doesn't answer the questions they want to ask.

This wasn't field of dreams though! So, how do I get recruiters to my
page? Well, rather than have a CV in MS Word format that I would post
onto every job site I could find, I had, a, link to my [FAQ] on a MS
Word doc! 🙃

On the MS Word doc I would have all the search terms a recruiter would
search for, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and so on at the bottom of
the document. At the top was a greeting:

![jobsite-cv]

It was a friendly hello and something different to what must be very
repetitive.

I used Google analytics's, on the [FAQ] and the [CV] to see how much
traffic they were getting, the [FAQ] a lot more than the [CV], so, I
could glean from that, that the recruiters were getting the answers to
their questions without having to pick up the phone. Win Win, right?

The stats weren't great however, with a bounce rate of around 3
seconds 😲 you could see the vast majority of recruiters would rather
pick up the phone than READ the information provided.
