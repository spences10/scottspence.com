<script>
  import { Banner } from '$lib/components'

  let href = `/posts/sveltekit-contact-form-example-with-airtable`
  const options = {
    type: 'info',
    message: `This post uses the legacy API keys used for Airtable, 
      there's a more up to date post on using personal access tokens
      <a href=${href} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      here</a>.`
  }
</script>

In this how-to I'll be walking through the process of creating a
contact form in SvelteKit using Airtable for storing the submissions
with no additional dependencies.

<!-- cSpell:ignore jeda -->

I got the inspiration for doing this when a saw a video on YouTube
from WebJeda on [SvelteKit Contact Form using Google Forms]. Sharath's
video is great but I'm not a fan of using Google products so thought I'd
try the same approach with Airtable.

<Banner {options} />

So, time for the standard preamble of the reasoning behind why a
contact form on your site is a good thing; Having a contact form on
your site is a great way to get people to get in touch with you whilst
on your site (great explanation! Right? üòÇ). I'm not opposed to adding
my email address to my website but some people prefer to contact you
from the context of the site.

Ok, preamble done let's get to the actual content!

## Create the project

I'll be doing this from scratch so you can follow along then implement
what you need from this example into your own project.

I'll start with creating a new project in SvelteKit.

```bash
npm init svelte@next svelte-and-airtable-contact-form-example
```

I'll select the following options from the CLI:

```text
‚úî Which Svelte app template? ‚Ä∫ Skeleton project
‚úî Use TypeScript? ‚Ä¶ No
‚úî Add ESLint for code linting? ‚Ä¶ No
‚úî Add Prettier for code formatting? ‚Ä¶ Yes
‚úî Add Playwright for browser testing? ‚Ä¶ No
```

Then I'll follow the rest of the steps from the CLI output:

```text
Next steps:
  1: cd svelte-and-airtable-contact-form-example
  2: npm install (or pnpm install, etc)
  3: git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit" # (optional)
  4: npm run dev -- --open
```

I use `pnpm` so will be using that in the terminal examples, you can
use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer. Live your life! üòÅ

Ok, now I have the project set up I can go about getting the backend
set up with Airtable.

## Set up Airtable

So, Airtable is like a hosted version of MS Excel, simply put, it's a
database with a nice UI. If you don't have an Airtable account you can
[sign up] over on the Airtable website.

I'll scroll to the bottom of the page and there's a '+ Add a
workspace' option. CLick that and select 'Create workspace', I'll be
prompted to give it a name I'll call it `form-submissions`, then I can
'Add a base'. Clicking 'Add a base' gives me the following screen:

[![airtable-untitled-base]] [airtable-untitled-base]

From here I'll rename the 'Untitled Base' to `contact-requests` and
'Table 1' to `submissions`. I can now go through the fields on there
and customise each field type by clicking on the small down arrow next
to the field name.

[![airtable-customise-field]] [airtable-customise-field]

In my example I'll add the following fields by renaming them and
changing the types with the 'Customize field type' option.

- 'name' as a 'Single line text' field
- 'email' as a 'Email' field
- 'message' as a 'Long text' field

You can add or remove any additional fields you want to store in
Airtable, you do you üòä.

## Set up Svelte form

For the contact form I'll make a Svelte component, that can be used
anywhere in the project so I'm not bound to having it in one place
like a (`https://mysite.com/contact`) route.

I'll create the `lib` folder and the `contact-form.svelte` file via
the terminal:

```bash
# create the directory/folder
mkdir src/lib
# create the Svelte component file
touch src/lib/contact-form.svelte
```

In the contact form component I'll create a simple form first, I'll
share a **full example later**.

```html
<form>
	<label for="name">
		<span>Name</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="text"
		name="name"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Enter your name"
		required
	/>
	<label for="email">
		<span>Email</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="email"
		name="email"
		aria-label="email"
		placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
		required
	/>
	<label for="message">
		<span>Message</span>
	</label>
	<textarea
		name="message"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Message"
		required
		rows="3"
	/>
	<input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Now I import the form for use in the project now, as there's only a
home page (`src/routes/index.svelte`) at the moment I'll add it there.

```svelte
<script>
	import ContactForm from '$lib/contact-form.svelte'
</script>

<h1>Welcome to SvelteKit</h1>
<p>
	Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to read the
	documentation
</p>

<ContactForm />
```

Now that I have the form sorted I'll need to capture the inputs to
submit to Airtable.

To capture the form inputs I'll need to create a `handleSubmit` method
in some `<script>` tags in the `src/lib/contact-from.svelte`
component.

To handle the form data I'll create a `new FormData()` object and
reference it with `data.currentTarget`. For now I'll console log out
the form data to validate.

```js
const handleSubmit = async data => {
	const formData = new FormData(data.currentTarget)

	console.log(formData.get('name'))
	console.log(formData.get('email'))
	console.log(formData.get('message'))
}
```

On the form I'll need to add in an event handler for `on:submit` using
the `handleSubmit` method. Currently the default form action will
cause a page refresh so along with the `handleSubmit` method I'll pipe
in the Svelte `preventDefault` modifier.

```svelte
<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
```

Here's what the component looks like now:

```svelte
<script>
	const handleSubmit = async data => {
		const formData = new FormData(data.currentTarget)

		console.log(formData.get('name'))
		console.log(formData.get('email'))
		console.log(formData.get('message'))
	}
</script>

<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
	<label for="name">
		<span>Name</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="text"
		name="name"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Enter your name"
		required
	/>
	<label for="email">
		<span>Email</span>
	</label>
	<input
		type="email"
		name="email"
		aria-label="email"
		placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
		required
	/>
	<label for="message">
		<span>Message</span>
	</label>
	<textarea
		name="message"
		aria-label="name"
		placeholder="Message"
		required
		rows="3"
	/>
	<input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Now, from the homepage I'll be able to add in some form values, click
submit and see them logged out in the browser console!

Ok now I have the form ready to submit data to Airtable I'll need to
create a SvelteKit endpoint to `POST` the data to Airtable.

## Get Airtable API keys

I'll be `POST`ing the data to the Airtable REST API, to do this I'm
going to need to reference the awesome Airtable documentation!

I can access it by clicking the 'HELP ?' link in the top right of the
base page. Clicking it will pop out the help panel and at the very
bottom of the panel is the '`<> API Documentation`' link.

[![airtable-help-panel]] [airtable-help-panel]

Clicking that will take me to the documentation for that base! What
I'm interested in here is the 'Create records' section. I'll scroll
down to that on the page.

[![airtable-api-documentation-create-record]]
[airtable-api-documentation-create-record]

<!-- cSpell:ignore appMdmn2bcQAUCeGb,keybJWwl29RhmPEQh -->

So at the moment this gives me the workspace ID `appMdmn2bcQAUCeGb`
and has `"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"` as well. If I click on
the 'show API key' in the top right hand corner it will show me the
API key `"Authorization: Bearer keybJWwl29RhmPEQh"`. I'll need this
for `POST`ing the form data to Airtable.

Also note the `"records"` array doesn't give me a great deal of
information as there's no data to display from my table.

What I'm going to do is go back to the table and add some dummy data
first then go back to the API documentation. I'll hop on over to the
table and add in some dummy data.

[![airtable-add-dummy-data]] [airtable-add-dummy-data]

No I can go back to the API documentation page and hit refresh and
I'll see the dummy data in the `"records"` array.

[![airtable-api-documentation-dummy-data]]
[airtable-api-documentation-dummy-data]

Why am I doing this? This is so I know the shape of the data that the
API is expecting!

Now onto creating the endpoint in SvelteKit to submit the data to
Airtable.

## Set up SvelteKit endpoint

I'm going to create a `contact-form` folder and a `index.json.js` to
go in there.

I'll do this with the following bash commands:

```bash
# create the endpoint folder
mkdir src/routes/contact-form
# create the endpoint index file
touch src/routes/contact-form/index.json.js
```

In the `index.json.js` file I'm going to create a post function that
will accept a `{request}` object. The `.json.js` file notation may
look a bit funky, this is letting SvelteKit know the return type of
the data (`JSON`) from the endpoint.

From that request coming into the endpoint I'll be able to get the
`formData` which needs to be submitted from the form to the endpoint!

I'll scaffold out the endpoint first, then go to the form to submit
the data to the endpoint, first in
`src/routes/contact-form/index.json.js` I'll add this:

```js
export const post = async ({ request }) => {
	const fd = await request.formData()

	const name = fd.get('name')
	const email = fd.get('email')
	const message = fd.get('message')

	console.log('name:', name)
	console.log('email:', email)
	console.log('message:', message)

	return {
		status: 200,
		body: { message: 'success' },
	}
}
```

This is so I can log out the details from the submission and confirm
they are being received by the endpoint.

Now in the contact form `<script>` tags I'll add in a request to the
`contact-form` endpoint.

```svelte
<script>
	const handleSubmit = async data => {
		const formData = new FormData(data.currentTarget)

		const res = await fetch('/contact-form.json', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: formData,
		})

		const { message } = await res.json()

		console.log(message)
	}
</script>
```

Here I'm making a request to the `contact-form` endpoint, defining the
`method` as a `POST` and the `body` as the `formData` from the form.

This is to validate the data from the form is being passed to the
endpoint, looking at the browser console and my terminal I can see
that the `formData` is being logged out on the endpoint and the
success message is being returned to the form!

## Environment variables

So I'm not committing my AirTable API keys to the repo, I'm going to
create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```bash
# create the .env file
touch .env
```

Then I'll add in the base ID (workspace ID) and the authorisation
bearer token:

```text
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appMdmn2bcQAUCeGb
VITE_AIRTABLE_TOKEN=keybJWwl29RhmPEQh
```

These need to be accessed with Vite's `import.meta` syntax.

## `POST` the data to Airtable

In my endpoint I'll remove the `console.log`'s and replace them with
the `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` the `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` and I'll take the
`AIRTABLE_URL` from the AirTable API documentation and replace the
`AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` in the `AIRTABLE_URL` with a variable. This can be
committed but I prefer to keep anything that can change to a minimum.

```js
const AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
const AIRTABLE_TOKEN = import.meta.env.VITE_AIRTABLE_TOKEN
const AIRTABLE_URL = `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/submissions`
```

I'll take the shape of the data being expected from the API
documentation and add it to a variable:

```js
let data = {
	records: [
		{
			fields: {
				name,
				email,
				message,
			},
		},
	],
}
```

The `name`, `email` and `message` variables taken from the `fd` object
can be added directly to the `data` variable now. This is why I
renamed the fields with lowercase characters üòä.

Then I'll create a `fetch` request to the `AIRTABLE_URL` endpoint,
adding in the `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` as the `Authorization` header and
specifying the content type as `application/json` and passing in the
`data` object for the `body` of the request:

```js
const res = await fetch(AIRTABLE_URL, {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		Authorization: `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_TOKEN}`,
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
	body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
```

I can now check that the request was successful from the from by
checking the `res.ok` status in an if statement:

```js
if (res.ok) {
	return {
		status: 200,
		body: {
			message: 'success',
		},
	}
} else {
	return {
		status: 404,
		body: {
			message: 'failed',
		},
	}
}
```

If you're not into code walls then scroll on! I'll share the source
for all of this at the end of this post.

Anyway, if you're interested, here's what the full
`src/routes/contact-form/index.json.js` file looks like now:

```js
export const post = async ({ request }) => {
	const fd = await request.formData()

	const name = fd.get('name')
	const email = fd.get('email')
	const message = fd.get('message')

	const AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
	const AIRTABLE_TOKEN = import.meta.env.VITE_AIRTABLE_TOKEN
	const AIRTABLE_URL = `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/submissions`

	let data = {
		records: [
			{
				fields: {
					name,
					email,
					message,
				},
			},
		],
	}
	const res = await fetch(AIRTABLE_URL, {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_TOKEN}`,
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify(data),
	})

	if (res.ok) {
		return {
			status: 200,
			body: {
				message: 'success',
			},
		}
	} else {
		return {
			status: 404,
			body: {
				message: 'failed',
			},
		}
	}
}
```

Sweet! So, I'll test this out now by adding in some form data to the
form and clicking the submit button!

Now if I go over to the AirTable `submissions` table I can see that
the form data I added is here! AWESOME!

## Managing form state

So I've submitted the data to the Airtable API, now I need to manage
the form state, as it is at the moment the form data is still there
after I click the submit button.

I can use the `message` I get back from the endpoint to control the
form. So I'll create a variable for the endpoint status.

I'll create a `submissionStatus` variable to control the form state
outside of the `handleSubmit` function, then inside of the
`handleSubmit` function I'll set the `submissionStatus` to
`submitting` then I know that the `POST` has started.

In the form I can use the Svelte `if` expression for the various
messages that can be returned from the endpoint.

```svelte
{#if submissionStatus === 'submitting'}
	<p>Submitting...</p>
{:else if submissionStatus === 'failed'}
	<p>Submission failed.</p>
{:else if submissionStatus === 'success'}
	<p>Submission success.</p>
{:else}
	<!-- form goes here! -->
{/if}
```

Another code wall warning! Here's the full
`src/routes/contact-form/index.svelte` file:

```svelte
<script>
	let submissionStatus = ''
	const handleSubmit = async data => {
		submissionStatus = 'submitting'
		const formData = new FormData(data.currentTarget)

		const res = await fetch('/contact-form.json', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: formData,
		})

		const { message } = await res.json()
		submissionStatus = message
	}
</script>

{#if submissionStatus === 'submitting'}
	<p>Submitting...</p>
{:else if submissionStatus === 'failed'}
	<p>Submission failed.</p>
{:else if submissionStatus === 'success'}
	<p>Submission success.</p>
{:else}
	<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
		<label for="name">
			<span>Name</span>
		</label>
		<input
			type="text"
			name="name"
			aria-label="name"
			placeholder="Enter your name"
			required
		/>
		<label for="email">
			<span>Email</span>
		</label>
		<input
			type="email"
			name="email"
			aria-label="email"
			placeholder="bill@hotmail.com"
			required
		/>
		<label for="message">
			<span>Message</span>
		</label>
		<textarea
			name="message"
			aria-label="name"
			placeholder="Message"
			required
			rows="3"
		/>
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>
{/if}
```

Now I can control the form state from the `submissionStatus` variable
and give a useful message back to the user on the status of the
submission!

Awesome, right?

But wait! There's more!

## Automation

So, let's think about this now; I now have another thing I need to
keep tabs on for message submissions, right?

**WRONG!** Airtable has an awesome integrations feature that you can
do loads of things with.

For this example though all I need really is to be notified when
there's a new submission.

So, I'll set that up now!

Back on over on the Airtable workspace much like where the help panel
link was there's also a link for 'Automations' in the top right.

Clicking on that will pop out the automations panel, on that I'll
select the 'Create a custom automation' link.

[![airtable-automations-panel]] [airtable-automations-panel]

That opens the automation flow.

[![airtable-automations-flow]] [airtable-automations-flow]

In here I can change the automation name by clicking on it to
something like `submission-email-automation`, note the default state
is off.

From hereI can add a trigger by clicking '+ Add trigger' and selecting
'When record is created'. The 'Run actions' panel then appears and I
can select '+ Add action' and select 'Send email'.

[![airtable-automations-run-action]] [airtable-automations-run-action]

I'll select the 'Send email' option.

You may have noticed the exclamation mark next to 'When a record is
created'. If I hover the mouse over it, it will expand to say 'Fix
configuration'. Clicking that pops open a configuration option in the
side panel to select the table. I'll pick the `submissions` table.

Then there'll be an exclamation next to the 'Send an email' option.
Hovering over that with the mouse gives the same 'Fix configuration'
message. Clicking that will open the configuration panel for email!

In that panel I can add in the email address I want the submission
sent to along with the subject line.

If I scroll down a little there's an option for the message, by
clicking the blue `+` button I can add in the message.

[![airtable-automations-configure-email]]
[airtable-automations-configure-email]

There's one option to 'Record (from Step 1: When a record is created),
clicking on 'Continue' will bring up the available properties. I'm
going to select to inset `name`, `email`, and `message`.

Next I can scroll down to the 'Testing' section, expand that and
select 'Test action'. I'll select to 'Run tests' and wait for the
result.

I get a successful result, so, now I can change the state of the
automation to 'On' and I'm done!

Now anytime a submission is made I'll get an email sent to my inbox!

## Conclusion

I've gone and created a simple form that will collect data from the
user of the site that will then post that data to an endpoint. When
someone submits a message via the form I'll receive an email so I can
action it without having to keep checking on the Airtable table.

You can check out the demo project and code for this post with some
minimal styles added over on [GitHub].
