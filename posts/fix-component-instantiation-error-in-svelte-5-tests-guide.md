<script>
  import { Banner } from '$lib/components'
  import { DateDistance } from '$lib/components'

  const options = {
    type: 'info',
    message: `The testing library has been updated. If you're not
      seeing this error in your tests, don't worry. Check 
      out the <a href="#update">update</a> at the end of the post 
      for the simpler approach.
    `
  }
</script>

So, you've just upgraded to Svelte 5 and are excited to test out your
components. But wait, what's this? You run your tests and hit an error
that's throwing a spanner in the works:

```bash
Error: Instantiating a component with 'new' is no longer valid in
Svelte 5. See
https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/breaking-changes#components-are-no-longer-classes
for more information.
```

<Banner {options} />

Annoying, right? The solution? Good ol' patch-package. After a bit of
searching I found an issue on the svelte-testing-library repo that
fixes the issue. The solution `patch-package` is a handy tool that
allows you to patch a package and keep the patch in your repo.

## Install and configure patch-package

Install `patch-package` as a dev dependency:

```bash
pnpm i -D patch-package
```

Then to configure it, add `patch-package` to run on your project on
`postinstall`, it's a script to add to your `package.json`:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"postinstall": "patch-package"
	}
}
```

Create a `patches` directory in the root of your project, this is
where the patch file is going to go.

```bash
# create the patches directory
mkdir patches
# create the patch file
touch patches/@testing-library+svelte+4.0.5.patch
```

## Patching the Package

The patch is a diff of the changes you want to make to the package,
full credit to [Stefan Hoelzl](https://github.com/stefanhoelzl) for
the
[patch](https://github.com/testing-library/svelte-testing-library/issues/284)
on the `svelte-testing-library` repo.

     },
     unmount: () => {
       if (componentCache.has(component)) component.$destroy()
```

Now, to run the patch all you need to do is run the install script on
your project, whatever that is:

```bash
pnpm i
```

The `postinstall` script will run `patch-package` and apply the patch
to the package. Now you can run your tests and they should work as
expected.

## Update

So, <DateDistance date='2024-02-16' /> ago there was an update to the
`svelte-testing-library` package which added support for Svelte 5 on
the `@next` tag for the package.

So, install the package at the `@next` tag:

```bash
pnpm i -D @testing-library/svelte@next
```

Then in any tests that use the `svelte-testing-library` package, I can
update the import to use `svelte5`:

```diff
+import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/svelte/svelte5'
-import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/svelte'
```

That's it, no need to patch the package anymore.
