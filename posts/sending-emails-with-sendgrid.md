Now I have a super sweet email pipeline for sending weekly emails
thanks to [Sam Larsen-Disney] I'm going to document what I've learnt and
what Sam taught me. (same thing, I guess) ðŸ˜Š

First up, I'd like to thank Sam for his patience walking me through
this a couple of times over now.

If you are looking to do something similar then the hope is that this
can give you an idea of what you need to do.

## Prerequisites

There's no real prerequisites here I'd say, having an email from your
custom domain is a nice touch but as far as I know not essential.

If you want to set up a custom email address to send from, I have done
this in the past with Zoho and you can check [Setting up a
Custom Email with Zoho] for details on that and also [Setting
up ProtonMail with Vercel] they're both for Vercel via the Vercel CLI.

I'll need a from on my site to collect the information with, I use
[Kwes Forms] which isn't completely redundant a this point as it has great
validation that I can use.

Also it was what I had in place already, if you're interested in Kwes
Forms take a look at the video here:

There are also other videos from friends of mine detailing the same
process:

- [Leigh Halliday]
- [James Q Quick]

## Add contacts to SendGrid

This is the code Sam kindly furnished me with, this can be gleaned
from SendGrid as well.

```js
/**
 * This is what is used to send the contact to SendGrid
 * the `list_ids` is from my contacts list in SendGrid
 * that is the id of my Newsletter list
 */

export default async function happyForm(email, name, list) {
	await fetch('https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts', {
		method: 'PUT',
		headers: {
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.GATSBY_SENDGRID_API_KEY}`,
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			list_ids: [list],
			contacts: [
				{
					email,
					first_name: name,
				},
			],
		}),
	})
}
```

To do that, if you create a new list in your contacts then

![sendgrid empty contact list]
