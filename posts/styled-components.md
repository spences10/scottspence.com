We're going to style the basic create react app with styled-components
to look something like this:

This is what it will look like by the end of this post:

![theme switch with styled-components]

But first, preamble✨: I have always struggled with styling sites, it
seems to be an aspect of starting web development that is either an
afterthought or glossed over. Up until December last year I didn't
really like styling anything at all with CSS, it was a chore rather
than something I enjoyed doing.

This was until I started using styled-components, when I joined a
build to learn project for a [Chingu] voyage ([`grad.then()`] if
you're interested) we decided to use a CSS-in-JS package, [Marina] who
was on my team was such an inspiration for me watching how components
were styled and really gave me the confidence to start using
styled-components.

## me with css before

<Details buttonText="Expand for an idea.">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2rj8VysAig8QE/giphy.gif" alt="impossible puzzle" />
</Details>

I want to share what I have learned so far by going through styling a
basic react application.

There's some basic CSS concepts in this post that I was not aware of
before starting out with styled-components that I presume are assumed
in styling web pages.

Styling the body element of a site is assumed, so for when you are
starting out with a blank canvas there are some defaults for all
modern web browsers you add to your site, like leaving font size at
16px (or 1rem) or `box-sizing:` `border-box;` there's some packages
out there to take care of this for you as well.

## Install styled-components

Ok let's bootstrap the basic react application you get when using
[Create React App] with [`npx`], if you already have Create React App
installed globally then you can use the command without `npx`.

```bash
npx create-react-app style-with-styled-components
cd style-with-styled-components/
npm i styled-components
```

Ok, now we have the basic app we can style, thankfully [Dan] has
kindly provided the starting styles for us so let's begin my using
them with styled-components.

The way the CRA CSS is laid out, assumes that you will have a
corresponding CSS file for each component, which can help with
maintaining the CSS and lends to the React idea of having all your
files separated into their component parts.

We can start with the `App.js` file and it's accompanying `App.css`
file. Let's take a look at the `App.js` first:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'
class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<header className="App-header">
					<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
					<h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
				</header>
				<p className="App-intro">
					To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to
					reload.
				</p>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
export default App
```

In styled-components we'd create components for each of these elements
that replace the aforementioned `className`'s. Ok we can start by
migrating our styles into components, let's do one component first to
get an idea of where we're going with this.

First, import `styled` into the `App.js` module:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
```

Now let's look at `<div className="App">`, it's the top level div for
this component and is what I like to call the wrapper for the
component. So let's give it an imaginative name AppWrapper.

Referring to the App.css there is `text-align: center;` which belongs
to this, so:

```js
const AppWrapper = styled.div`
	text-align: center;
`
```

So here we have defined the `AppWrapper` const as a `styled.div`
followed by back ticks inside of the back ticks we can write any
regular CSS with the exact same CSS syntax you wold in a normal `.css`
file.

Now that we have our `AppWrapper` we can replace the top level div on
the `App.js` component.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'
class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<AppWrapper>
				<header className="App-header">
					<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
					<h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
				</header>
				<p className="App-intro">
					To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to
					reload.
				</p>
			</AppWrapper>
		)
	}
}
export default App
```

## styled-components all the things

So let's do that for the remaining four CSS classes, and take a look,
I'll define them underneath the `AppWrapper` here:

```js
const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`
const AppLogo = styled.img`
	animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
	height: 80px;
`
const AppHeader = styled.div`
	background-color: #222;
	height: 150px;
	padding: 20px;
	color: white;
`
const AppTitle = styled.h1`
	font-size: 1.3em;
`
const AppIntro = styled.p`
	font-size: large;
`
```

So first off we've created a variable for the React svg [animation],
you'll need to import the `keyframes` helper from styled-components
like so:

```js
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'
```

this can now be used throughout the `App.js` component and we can add
an on `hover` selector to any of our styled-components within this
module. Here we're going to add it to the `AppLogo` to keep the super
sweet rotating React logo.

```js
const AppLogo = styled.img`
	animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
	height: 80px;
	&:hover {
		animation: ${rotate360} infinite 1.5s linear;
	}
`
```

Ok, our app shouldn't look any different as we haven't added in our
styled-components to the app `render()` method, so let's do that now.

Let's also change the intro text. You can add a wrapper for the
`<code>` tags something like:

```js
const CodeWrapper = styled.code`
	font-size: 1.3rem;
`
```

But if you prefer you can nest selectors within the component, like:

```js
const AppIntro = styled.p`
	color: ${props => props.theme.dark};
	font-size: large;
	code {
		font-size: 1.3rem;
	}
`
```

Let's have a look at the `render()` method now…

```js
render() {
  return (
    <AppWrapper>
      <AppHeader>
        <AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
        <AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
      </AppHeader>
      <AppIntro>
        Bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>.
      </AppIntro>
      <AppIntro>
        Components styled with <code>styled-components</code>{' '}
        <EmojiWrapper aria-label="nail polish"></EmojiWrapper>
      </AppIntro>
    </AppWrapper>
  )
}
```

<!-- cSpell:ignore aaaaand -->

Now all the classes originally used in `App.js` have been replaced so
there's no need for the `import './App.css'` mapping, remove that
aaaaand! Still no change!! Which is a good thing because at the moment
we're swapping out the `.css` files for styled-components.

Cool, we have now replaced all the css with styled-components, now we
can take a look at `injectGlobal`.

Let's take a look at how the `App.js` file should look before we move
on:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'
import logo from './logo.svg'

const AppWrapper = styled.div`
	text-align: center;
`

const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`

const AppLogo = styled.img`
	animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
	height: 80px;
	&:hover {
		animation: ${rotate360} infinite 1.5s linear;
	}
`

const AppHeader = styled.div`
	background-color: #222;
	height: 12rem;
	padding: 1rem;
	color: white;
`

const AppTitle = styled.h1`
	font-weight: 900;
`

const AppIntro = styled.p`
	font-size: large;
	code {
		font-size: 1.3rem;
	}
`

const EmojiWrapper = styled.span.attrs({
	role: 'img',
})``

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<AppWrapper>
				<AppHeader>
					<AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
					<AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
				</AppHeader>
				<AppIntro>
					Bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>.
				</AppIntro>
				<AppIntro>
					Components styled with <code>styled-components</code>{' '}
					<EmojiWrapper aria-label="nail polish" />
				</AppIntro>
			</AppWrapper>
		)
	}
}

export default App
```

## Style the body with injectGlobal

For styling the body of our react app we currently have the
`index.css` file that is being imported into the mounting point of our
app in the `index.js` file.

To style the body we can use [`injectGlobal`] from styled-components
which adds the styles directly to the stylesheet.

To do this you bring in the `injectGlobal` named export from
styled-components and add your styles between the back ticks.

The current `index.css` looks like this:

```css
body {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
	font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Let's add a `theme` folder in the `src` directory and add a
`globalStyle.js` file where we can keep all our styles we want to use
throughout the app, keeping the styles on one place will make changes
simpler.

In `src/theme/globalStyle.js` we'll need to import the `injectGlobal`
named export from styled-components and add the `index.css` styles
into it:

```js
import { injectGlobal } from 'styled-components'

injectGlobal`
  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
`
```

Ok, now we're adding the body style to the stylesheet directly so
there is no need for the `index.css` file mapping that is in
`index.js` it should look like this now:

```js
import React from 'react' import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './App'

import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))

registerServiceWorker()
```

<!-- cSpell:ignore roboto -->

We should still have our nice `sans-serif` font going on, but let's
add in some nice Roboto for the body and Montserrat for the heading in
our `globalStyle.js` module. We can import Google fonts with an
`@import` in `injectGlobal` and apply Roboto to the body:

```js
injectGlobal`
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Roboto');
 
  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
  }
`
```

Cool now we can add our imported font for or app header, and there's
the option if we want all our `<h1>`'s to use the same font we can add
that to the injectGlobal in our `globalStyle.js` module.

```js
injectGlobal`
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:400,900|Roboto');
  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
  }
  h1 {
    font-family: Montserrat;
  }
`
```

Then we can adjust the weight on the `AppTitle` component:

```js
const AppTitle = styled.h1`
	font-weight: 900;
`
```

To add the additional styles for fonts like Montserrat and Roboto you
can specify them in the `@import url()` you'll notice that Montserrat
has `:400,900` after it that is specifying the styles regular (400)
and black (900), you can import as many as you like from Google fonts
(CDN) but the more you import the longer it will take to load them, if
you have a lot of fonts and styles you want in your app then consider
adding them to a folder in the project, like:

```js
import Montserrat from './fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf'

injectGlobal`@font-face { font-family: Montserrat; src: url(${Montserrat}); }`
```

## Theming

Themes are often used to change the look and feel of a wide range of
things at once. For example, you may have a night and day mode like in
Twitter. You can create your own themes in styled-components too.

![light and dark theme]

## Use the styled-components ThemeProvider

Now say we want to have several components in our app that use a CSS
colour property `color: #6e27c5` instead of hard coding it through the
app for every component that uses it we can use the styled-components
`ThemeProvider`.

For this we will need to import the `ThemeProvider` named export from
styled-components, then define a `theme` object where our colour is
going to live:

```js
export const theme = {
	primary: '#6e27c5',
}
```

Let's add the newly created `theme` to the `globalStyle` module we
created previously.

To make the theme object available throughout the app component we'll
wrap our app component in the `ThemeProvider` and import our awesome
theme for use in the `ThemeProvider`:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { keyframes, ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import { theme } from './theme/globalStyle'

// our styled-components

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
				{/* all children can access the theme object */}
			</ThemeProvider>
		)
	}
}
export default App
```

Now the `theme` properties can be used as props in our
styled-components, let's change the `background-color:` in the
`AppHeader` component, whilst we're at it let's add a `dark: #222`
property to our `theme` object and use that for the `color` property:

```js
const AppHeader = styled.div`
	height: 12rem;
	padding: 1rem;
	color: ${props => props.theme.dark};
	background-color: ${props => props.theme.primary};
`
```

Now we can change our app theme globally

## Ok cool, can you change theme?

This is what I was thinking and it turns out you can, there's a great
[Stack Overflow answer] from [Max] on it.

It got me thinking if you can switch between themes rather than define
them for different sections like in the SO answer.

I started off by defining two themes (with imaginative names) in the
`globalStyle.js` module:

```js
export const theme1 = {
	primary: '#ff0198',
	secondary: '#01c1d6',
	danger: '#eb238e',
	light: '#f4f4f4',
	dark: '#222',
}

export const theme2 = {
	primary: '#6e27c5',
	secondary: '#ffb617',
	danger: '#f16623',
	light: '#f4f4f4',
	dark: '#222',
}
```

Now we need a way to switch between the two `theme` objects, let's use
a select box for them, let's create a components folder and in there
make a `ThemeSelect.js` component, we can worry about refactoring the
`App.js` component when I'm not here :

## ThemeSelect.js

<!-- cSpell:ignore rgba -->

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Select = styled.select`
	margin: 2rem 0.5rem;
	padding: 0rem 0.5rem;
	font-family: Roboto;
	font-size: 1rem;
	border: 1px solid ${props => props.theme.light};
	box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	background: ${props => props.theme.light};
	border-radius: 2px;
`

export const SelectOpt = styled.option`
	font-family: Roboto;
	font-size: 1rem;
`

class ThemeSelect extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<Select onChange={e => this.props.handleThemeChange(e)}>
					<SelectOpt value="theme1">Theme 1</SelectOpt>
					<SelectOpt value="theme2">Theme 2</SelectOpt>
				</Select>
			</div>
		)
	}
}

export default ThemeSelect
```

You've probably noticed the
`onChange={e => this.props.handleThemeChange(e)` event, we're going to
add that method to the `App.js` component along with some state to
manage what theme is selected.

## App.js

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { keyframes, ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

import logo from './logo.svg'

import { theme1, theme2 } from './theme/globalStyle'
import ThemeSelect from './components/ThemeSelect'

// our lovely styled-components here

class App extends Component {
	state = {
		theme: theme1,
	}
	handleThemeChange = e => {
		let theme = e.target.value
		theme === 'theme1' ? (theme = theme1) : (theme = theme2)
		this.setState({ theme })
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<ThemeProvider theme={this.state.theme}>
				<AppWrapper>
					<AppHeader>
						<AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
						<AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
					</AppHeader>
					<AppIntro>
						Bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>.
					</AppIntro>
					<AppIntro>
						Components styled with <code>styled-components</code>{' '}
						<EmojiWrapper aria-label="nail polish" />
					</AppIntro>
					<ThemeSelect handleThemeChange={this.handleThemeChange} />
				</AppWrapper>
			</ThemeProvider>
		)
	}
}

export default App
```

To summarise what we have done with `App.js` here is, add some state
to default to theme1 where the two themes are imported as named
exports of the `globalStyle.js` module.

Add a method to handle the change of the `ThemeSelect.js` component
`handleThemeChange` this is where we can switch between the two
`theme` objects.

Let's try it out, we should be able to switch between the two themes
we've defined now.

## Extending styled-components

So far our app hasn't got many styled-components that are similar but
what if we were to add some buttons…

```js
export const Button = styled.button`
	font-size: 1rem;
	border-radius: 5px;
	padding: 0.25rem 1rem;
	margin: 0 1rem;
	background: transparent;
	color: ${props => props.theme.primary};
	border: 2px solid ${props => props.theme.primary};
	${props =>
		props.primary &&
		css`
			background: ${props => props.theme.primary};
			color: white;
		`};
`
```

Here I've added a `Button` component to the `globalStyle.js` for us to
use in the `App.js` component. For the sake of convenience we're going
to add it here, you may find if you have a lot of similar components
that you are reusing throughout your app that it may be a good idea to
add them all to a `components` folder.

We can import the `Button` as you would any other component and use it
in the module, as we're extending it this means we only need to apply
the specific styles we want for that button. But first in the `App.js`
component we can specify a normal and a primary button:

```html
<button>Normal Button</button> <button primary>Primary Button</button>
```

Now to specify another button with the same css as the imported button
we can extend it, like in this example we'll make the button take up
40% of the screen width and make the corners more rounded:

```js
const BigButt = Button.extend`
	height: 3rem;
	font-size: 2rem;
	width: 40vw;
	border-radius: 30px;
`
```

Let's also apply the theme for an underline on `create-react-app` and
`styled-components` by adding in an `Underline` styled-component:

```js
const Underline = styled.span`
	border-bottom: 4px solid ${props => props.theme.secondary};
`
```

Now we can switch the theme and have it applied to our components
using the theme, pretty neat, right?

I have put all of the examples we have gone over here in a working
example for you to play around with the theming and styled-components,
enjoy.
