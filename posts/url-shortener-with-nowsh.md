Remember services like [Bitly] and [TinyURL]? Yeah, they still exist,
shortening your URLs for you, they've been around for a long time too.

Bitly founded in 2008 and TinyURL founded in 2002 üò±

In this post I'm detailing how I made my own Bitly with Now.sh.

You can make your own one too as I'm about to detail the process here,
or you can **[TL;DR]** for the video.

What you need:

- Node (to run the now CLI)
- The [now CLI]
- [Vercel.com account]
- [GitHub account] (not essential)
- Yor own domain (not essential)

## Examples, why would I use a short URL?

I use short URLs for sharing my content, if you take a look at this
blog post URL is quite long and not something you can reel off quickly
to someone.

There's a talk I did about Gatsby, titled "Build-time and Client
Run-time Data Fetching in Gatsby" the URL for it is:

- https://gatsby-build-and-run-time-data-fetching-talk.now.sh

With a short URL I can condense it down a bit:

- https://ss10.dev/gatsby-data-fetching

Not massively shorter, and granted the original URL has no place being
that long!

Other examples could be the "Build a coding blog from scratch with
Gatsby and MDX" guide I did at the end of last year:

- Full URL https://scottspence.com/posts/build-an-mdx-blog
- Short URL https://ss10.dev/bab-guide

Or if you have a crazy URL no one is going to be able to recite from
memory, like my YouTube channel URL:

- Full URL https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnngLXpLSFsKkDhFoO9Ct3w
- Short URL https://ss10.dev/youtube
- Shorter still https://ss10.dev/yt

I do have a vanity URL for my YouTube channel which is
https://www.youtube.com/c/ScottSpencePlease, but it's case sensitive.

## Do I have to use Vercel? ü§î

No, you can use Netlify as well. There's a great [Kent C Dodds
example with Netlify] that I used before moving to Vercel.

You don't have to use Netlify either, you do you. üò∏

There's many ways to do it and the best way for you may be different
to me. You will need a domain name and a hosting service, that's what
I'm doing with Vercel here.

## Redirects

The way I'm doing this is with redirects, so it will be like in the
examples earlier, give a path to your URL then use a redirect rule.

```json
{
	"source": "/yt",
	"destination": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnngLXpLSFsKkDhFoO9Ct3w"
}
```

## Get set up üõ†

If you don't have a machine set up for web development I have written
about getting set up [for Windows].

There's also a video I've made to go from scratch to Create React App
on Ubuntu 19.04.

<YouTube youTubeId="eSAsdQuQ-1o" />

If you're following along and you haven't done so already, you'll need
to install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# if you're using npm, then
# npm i -g now
yarn global add now
```

Then you'll need to authenticate with the CLI:

```bash
now login
```

You will be prompted with a phrase, something like `Handsome Turtle`
that should match the phrase in the email Vercel sends you. You can
authenticate by clicking the link in the email.

## Create the project

I'm going to create a directory for the project to live in, then
change into that directory and make the project with `yarn init -y`.

```bash
mkdir short-urls # create directory
cd short-urls # change to newly created dir
yarn init -y # initialise the project
```

That's going to create my `package.json` file with the project details
in it.

Next to create the `now.json` file this is going to be where all the
redirects live:

```bash
touch now.json
```

In the `now.json` file I'm going to add the Vercel Now platform
version then the redirects array with the first redirect being where I
want my domain to default to.

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"redirects": [
		{
			"source": "/",
			"destination": "https://scottspence.me"
		}
	]
}
```

## Deploy the project

That is all the configuration I need for now, now I'm going to deploy
the project using the CLI this will push the project to the Vercel
hosting service.

To deploy the current directory I'll do the following command:

```bash
now
```

As this is the first time I've deployed this project there will be a
lot of prompts from the CLI, I'll answer the default answer to all of
these questions:

```text
- Set up and deploy project?: y
- Which scope (this is my user account): Scott Spence
- Link to an existing project?: n
- Whats your project name (hit return): short-urls
- In which directory is your code located (hit return)?: /
- Want to override the settings?: n
```

The CLI will output two URLs, the first to my project on Vercel Now
and the second for the actual project. I'll click on the first one and
and inspect the project.

As I set the root of the redirect to go to my portfolio site that's
what I have in my project overview in Vercel.

![vercel project overview]

<!-- cSpell:ignore fzph -->

I can now take that URL (now-short-urls-fzph462o0.now.sh) add it to a
browser and it will redirect to https://scottspence.me.

Now when I deploy this with the `--prod` flag in the Vercel CLI it
will use the project URL (now-short-urls.now.sh).

Ok so that was quite straightforward, right?

Now each time I want to add a short URL I'll add it to the `now.json`
file and run the Vercel CLI again to deploy the project.

But I can take out the deployment part and leave that to the Vercel
GitHub integration.

So, better get that project on GitHub!

## Add the Project to GitHub

Go to GitHub, click on the plus icon next to my profile picture,
select '[New repository]'.

Enter the new project name and click the 'Create repository' button.

GitHub supplies the git commands to get the project onto GitHub.

Before that I'm going to initialise my project and add what I have to
git:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'init üî•'
```

Then add the remote repository and push to it:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:spences10/short-urls.git
git push -u origin master
```

That's it the project is now on GitHub and I can start using the
Vercel GitHub integration.

## Use Vercel for GitHub

Vercel has a GitHub integration so that you can deploy automatically
from a push to your master branch on your project or via a pull
request.

The Vercel documentation for this is really good so I'm going to link
that [here].

The docs will walk you through setting up the GitHub integration with
your GitHub account and linking a project.

There are also integrations available for [GitLab] and [Bitbucket].

Now each time I add a short url to my project all I have to do is git
commit and push to GitHub and the Vercel GitHub integration will take
care of the rest.

## Add my domain to Vercel

Now I'm going to add my own domain to Vercel from the 'Settings' panel
of my project I can select 'Domains' and add in my own domain.

My domain isn't supplied by Vercel so I will need to configure the DNS
settings in my domain provider by adding the custom DNS configuration
supplied here by Vercel.

![vercel domains settings]

The cool thing with Vercel is that I can have many domains pointing to
the same project.
