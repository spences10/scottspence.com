How do you filter a JavaScript object that has duplicate properties?
Use reduce! The specific situation I had is a list of objects with
duplicate properties. I wanted to filter out the duplicates and return
a new object with only the unique properties.

There's two sections here, the first is how I approached the solution
then, there's the [much simpler approach] which I have now adopted.

## What the data looks like

Here's a small example of what the object looked like:

```json
[
	{
		"productId": "1",
		"slug": "laptop",
		"productName": "Laptop",
		"variant": "16gb"
	},
	{
		"productId": "1",
		"slug": "laptop",
		"productName": "Laptop",
		"variant": "32gb"
	},
	{
		"productId": "2",
		"slug": "tablet",
		"productName": "Tablet",
		"variant": "32gb"
	},
	{
		"productId": "2",
		"slug": "tablet",
		"productName": "Tablet",
		"variant": "128gb"
	}
]
```

I'd be using the different variants on another part of the project so
they weren't really relevant here. All I really needed was the
`productName` and some other details that I've not added to the
example object here.

A lot of the examples you'll see on using reduce will be to count up a
value, in my case I needed to have only the relevant information to
add back into an object to build out the page details.

A mentor of mine, [Leigh] Halliday has done some great videos
detailing how to use reduce.

reduce go check out Leigh's videos!

## My approach

<!-- cSpell:ignore umulator -->

So, my specific use-case! I'll first set up the `.reduce` function
with the `acc`umulator (the thing I'm adding to) and the current
`item` in the reduce, then return the `acc` which is what I want at
the end of the reduce.

Then finally add the initial value of the reduce which I want
returned, in this case it's an array `[]`.

```js
items.reduce((acc, item) => {
	return acc
}, [])
```

Great I get an empty array back. So now I need to start adding items
to the `acc`.

I'll set up a check to see if the `item.productId` is already in the
`acc` and if it's not add it to the `acc` an if statement adding the
`item` to the `acc`.

Then I'll add the matching `item` for the `productId` to the `acc`.

```js
items.reduce((acc, item) => {
	if (!acc[item.productId]) {
		acc[item] = item
	}
	acc[item.productId] = item
	return acc
}, [])
```

There's an empty slot in the `acc` for the `productId` so I'll add a
`.filter` to the end of the `.reduce` so that any items that are
`null` are removed from the `acc`.

Here's the finished code:

```js
const products = items
	.reduce((acc, item) => {
		if (!acc[item.productId]) {
			acc[item] = item
		}
		acc[item.productId] = item
		return acc
	}, [])
	.filter(item => item !== null)
```

## Leigh's approach

After running my approach past [Leigh], he had a much simpler
solution!

He had a small suggestion on the final code... the initial value
should probably be an object `{}` so that I can check if the
`productId` exists inside of that object.

What I'd get at the end though would be an object where the keys are
the product ids... so if I just want the deduped values, I could use
`Object.values()` to extract them.

<!-- cSpell:ignore deduped,leighs -->

```js
const dedupedObject = items.reduce((acc, item) => {
	if (!acc[item.productId]) {
		acc[item.productId] = item
	}
	return acc
}, {})
const dedupedArray = Object.values(dedupedObject)
```

I could even go a step further and just remove the if statement, since
it would just override the previous product with the same product id:

```js
const dedupedObject = items.reduce((acc, item) => {
	acc[item.productId] = item
	return acc
}, {})
const dedupedArray = Object.values(dedupedObject)
```

A lot more simpler than my solution! Thanks Leigh!

That's it! Hope you found it useful!
