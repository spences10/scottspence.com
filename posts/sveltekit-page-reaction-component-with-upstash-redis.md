I made a reactions component in SvelteKit that uses Upstash Redis to
store the user reactions. It uses a SvelteKit form action to submit
the reaction to the server. It's a nice example of how to use Upstash
with SvelteKit.

I'll go through creating the project so you can follow along if you
like or you can Tl;Dr and go to the [example](#example).

## Create the Upstash Redis database

Upstash make it really straightforward to create a Redis database.

Go to https://console.upstash.com/login and create an account if you
don't have one already.

In the Redis databases section I'll click on the 'Create Database'
button. I'm then prompted to give the database a name, I'll call it
`sveltekit-reactions`.

For the type I can choose between 'Global' or 'Regional'. I'll go with
the default 'Global' option.

The primary region I'll go with where the project will be built which
will eventually be on Vercel so I'll go with `us-west-2`. For the read
region I'll go with `us-west-1`.

I'll leave the rest of the options as the default and click the
'Create' button.

[![sveltekit-page-reactions-redis-details-dashboard]]
[sveltekit-page-reactions-redis-details-dashboard]

Take note of the 'REST API' section here, I'll need the
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and the ` UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to go
into the `.env` file in the project.

Which brings me to the next step.

## Create the SvelteKit project

Aight! Now I can scaffold out the SvelteKit project. I'll add in the
terminal commands if you're following along, I'll kick off the
SvelteKit CLI with the `pnpm create` command.

```bash
pnpm create svelte sveltekit-reactions
```

I'll pick the following options:

```text
create-svelte version 5.0.2

‚îå  Welcome to SvelteKit!
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Which Svelte app template?
‚îÇ  Skeleton project
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Add type checking with TypeScript?
‚îÇ  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add ESLint for code linting
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Prettier for code formatting
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Playwright for browser testing
‚îÇ  ‚óº Add Vitest for unit testing
‚îî
```

Then change directory into the project and install the dependencies I
need, right now I'll install `@upstash/redis` and `@upstash/ratelimit`
as dev dependencies.

```bash
cd sveltekit-reactions
pnpm i -D @upstash/redis @upstash/ratelimit
```

So I'm not messing around with styling I'll install Tailwind CSS with
the daisyUI and Tailwind typography plugins with `svelte-add`.

```bash
npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss --daisyui --typography
# install configured dependencies
pnpm i
```

Now a quick check to see if everything is working as expected.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Sweet! So, now onto creating the form component with the reactions.

## Create the reactions component

I'll create the folders and files I need now for the project. First,
the reactions component which I'm going to put in the
`src/lib/components` directory. The `-p` flag will create the parent
directory if it doesn't exist.

Then create additional files for configuring the component, a utils
file for re-useable functions and another file for the Upstash Redis
client.

I'll do that with the following commands.

```bash
# make the components lib directory
mkdir src/lib/components -p
# make the reactions component
touch src/lib/components/reactions.svelte
touch src/lib/{config,redis,utils}.ts
# add the page server file fo the form action
touch src/routes/+page.server.ts
```

The component will be a form that will submit the reaction to the
server via a SvelteKit form action.

I'll scaffold out the component first then move onto the form action.

Rather than have a predefined set of reactions I'll make it so that
the user can add their own reactions in the `src/lib/config.ts` file.

I'll also add in the config for the Upstash `Ratelimit.slidingWindow`
here as well, ten requests inside a ten second window. (üëà more on
this later)

```ts
export const reactions = [
	{ type: 'likes', emoji: 'üëç' },
	{ type: 'hearts', emoji: '‚ù§Ô∏è' },
	{ type: 'poops', emoji: 'üí©' },
	{ type: 'parties', emoji: 'üéâ' },
]

export const limit_requests = 10
export const limit_window = '10 s'
```

Then in the `src/lib/components/reactions.svelte` file I'll import the
reactions from the config file and use them in the component.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { reactions } from '$lib/config'

	export let path: string | null = '/'
</script>

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<form
		method="POST"
		action="/?path={path}"
		class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
	>
		{#each reactions as reaction}
			<button
				name="reaction"
				type="submit"
				value={reaction.type}
				class="btn btn-primary text-3xl font-bold shadow-xl"
			>
				<span>
					{reaction.emoji}
				</span>
			</button>
		{/each}
	</form>
</div>
```

I've added some Tailwind and daisyUI classes to the form for some
basic styling.

So, for now I just want to render out the emoji reaction as I've not
wired up the count from redis yet.

I have added a `POST` method to the form and a `name` and `type`
attribute to the button. This will be used in the form action to get
the value of the button that was clicked.

I also added in the `action` attribute which points to where the
action is located, in my case I'm going to create the action in the
`src/routes/+page.server.ts` file so I'll use `/` for the route.

I'll also add in a `path` prop which I'll need to identify the page
that the reaction was submitted from, I'll default it to the index `/`
if there's nothing passed. I can then pass the `path` to the form
action as a query parameter, so, on the server, I can get the path
(`url.searchParams.get('path')`) for use in identifying where the
reaction came from.

So I can see what's going on with the component as I build it out I'll
stick the component on the index page.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import Reactions from '$lib/components/reactions.svelte'
</script>

<h1>Welcome to SvelteKit</h1>
<p>
	Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to read the
	documentation
</p>

<Reactions />
```

If I click one of the buttons now I get a `405` error telling me that
a `POST` method is not allowed as there are no actions for the page.

I'll create the form action next.

## Create the form action

Now I want to get the form action working so I can get the value of
the button that was clicked and send it to the server.

In the `src/routes/+page.server.ts` file I'll add in an actions
object, in this case I'm going to need only the default action.

In the default action I'll need the form data which I can get out of
the `event.request` which will be `name` and `value` of the button
that was clicked. I can then get the `reaction` out of the `data`
object.

The last thing I'll need is the `path` which will be the page the
component is on. In the previous section I added a `path` prop to the
component currently it's defaulting to `/`.

For now I want to validate the action is working so I'll just log out
the data to the console.

```ts
export const actions = {
	default: async ({ request, url }) => {
		const data = await request.formData()
		const reaction = data.get('reaction')
		const path = url.searchParams.get('path')

		console.log('=====================')
		console.log(data)
		console.log(reaction)
		console.log(path)
		console.log('=====================')
		return {}
	},
}

export const load = async () => {
	return {}
}
```

I'll return and empty object for the `default` action and the `load`
function for now.

Clicking on one of the buttons now I can see the data in the terminal
where the dev server is running.

```bash
=====================
FormData { [Symbol(state)]: [ { name: 'reaction', value: 'likes' } ] }
likes
/
=====================
```

Cool, so I now have the base of what I want to store in Redis.

## Add the Redis client

Now I'll set up the redis client, I'll first need to create a `.env`
file to add the Upstash API keys to. I'll create the `.env` file in
the root of the project from the terminal.

```bash
touch .env
```

Then get the REST API keys from my Upstash dashboard, I'll scroll to
the REST API section, select the `.env` option then use the handy copy
option and paste them into the `.env` file.

[![sveltekit-page-reactions-redis-dashboard-env-keys]]
[sveltekit-page-reactions-redis-dashboard-env-keys]

Now I can import the keys into the `src/lib/redis.ts` file and create
the Redis client and initialise Upstash Ratelimit. I'll also add in
the config for the Upstash `Ratelimit.slidingWindow` here as well.

```ts
import { building } from '$app/environment'
import {
	UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
	UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
} from '$env/static/private'
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit'
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis'
import { limit_requests, limit_window } from './config'

let redis: Redis
let ratelimit: Ratelimit

if (!building) {
	redis = new Redis({
		url: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
		token: UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
	})

	ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
		redis,
		limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(limit_requests, limit_window),
	})
}

export { ratelimit, redis }
```

I'm checking if the app is building and if it's not I'll create the
Redis client and initialise Upstash Ratelimit and export these for use
in the `src/routes/+page.server.ts` file.

## Add reactions to Redis

Now I can check the connection is working and start adding the
reactions to the Upstash Redis database on button click.

I won't go into the specifics of Redis here as there are plenty of
resources out there for that. Essentially it's a key value pair, the
key in this case being the reaction and the page it was clicked on.

I want to know the page the reaction was clicked on so that's why I'm
passing in the `path` to the form action. So when I create the key I
can use the `path` and the `reaction` to create a unique key.

If I use the component on the about page and someone clicks the like
button the key in the Redis database will be `about:likes`. I'm then
using the [`incr`] method to increment the value of the key by one.

```ts
import { redis } from '$lib/redis.js'

export const actions = {
	default: async ({ request, url }) => {
		const data = await request.formData()
		const reaction = data.get('reaction')
		const path = url.searchParams.get('path')

		const redis_key = `${path}:${reaction}`

		const result = await redis.incr(redis_key)

		return {
			success: true,
			status: 200,
			reaction: reaction,
			path: path,
			count: result,
		}
	},
}

export const load = async () => {
	return {}
}
```

Once the key is created and the value is incremented I can return the
data to the client. I'll return the `reaction`, `path` and the `count`
which is the value of the key.

I can now receive the `data` as a prop to the component.

## Get Redis data into component

Ok, in my component/form I can now accept a `data` prop which will
have the `reaction`, `path` and `count` from the server in it. But the
data from the server isn't going back to the component it's going back
to where the component is being used.

So, in my index page I'll need to accept the `data` prop coming back
from the server (form action) which I can then pass to the component.

On the index page I'll accept the `data` prop to the page and pass
that onto the component.

I'll also add in a `pre` tag to visually see the shape of the data.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import Reactions from '$lib/components/reactions.svelte'

	export let data: any
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>

<h1>Welcome to SvelteKit</h1>
<p>
	Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to read the
	documentation
</p>

<Reactions {data} />
```

Now I can pass the `data` prop to the component and use it to show the
count of the reaction along with another `pre` tag to show the shape
of the data.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { reactions } from '$lib/config'

	export let data: any
</script>

<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<form
		method="POST"
		action="/"
		class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
	>
		{#each reactions as reaction}
			<button
				name="reaction"
				type="submit"
				value={reaction.type}
				class="btn btn-primary text-3xl font-bold shadow-xl"
			>
				<span>
					{reaction.emoji}
				</span>
			</button>
		{/each}
	</form>
</div>
```

Yes, I'm using an `any` type here, I'll fix that later. For now I want
to see the data from the server.

The data for both the page and the component is showing an empty
object at the moment because I haven't loaded the data from the server
yet.

In my `src/routes/+page.server.ts` file I'll need to get the data from
Redis for each reaction type for the path of the page.

First up I'll get my reaction types from the config file and pull out
the `reaction.type` then use that to map over and get the data from
Redis with a `Promise.all` and then return the data.

```ts
export const load = async ({ url: { pathname } }) => {
	const reaction_types = reactions.map(reaction => reaction.type)
	const promises = reaction_types.map(reaction =>
		redis.get(`${pathname}:${reaction}`),
	)
	const results = await Promise.all(promises)

	const count = {} as any
	reaction_types.forEach((reaction, index) => {
		count[reaction] = Number(results[index]) || 0
	})

	return { count }
}
```

Again! I'll come onto the `any` type later.

Checking the index page I now get the reactions data loaded on both
the page and in the component.

Clicking on a reaction button now increments the count and I can see
the result in the `pre` tag, I can remove these now.

## Show the count

Now to show the count of each reaction type. I'll add a `span` tag
inside the button and show the count there. I can pick the count out
of the `data` prop that's being passed in for each reaction type.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { reactions } from '$lib/config'

	export let path: string | null = '/'
	export let data: any
</script>

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<form
		method="POST"
		action="/?path={path}"
		class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
	>
		{#each reactions as reaction}
			<button
				name="reaction"
				type="submit"
				value={reaction.type}
				class="btn btn-primary text-3xl font-bold shadow-xl"
			>
				<span>
					{reaction.emoji}
					{data?.count?.[reaction.type] || 0}
				</span>
			</button>
		{/each}
	</form>
</div>
```

I'll sort out the `any` type now.

## TypeScript types

I'll address the `any` type now and add in some TypeScript types for
the `data` prop. So I need a way to represent the Redis data, it looks
something like this:

```json
{
	"count": {
		"likes": 3,
		"hearts": 1,
		"poops": 0,
		"parties": 0
	}
}
```

Keys are strings and the values are numbers. So I'll create a
`ReactionCount` interface to represent the count.

I'll also create a `ReactionsData` interface to represent the data
coming back from the server. This will have a `path` and a `count`
which is the `ReactionCount` interface.

```ts
interface ReactionCount {
	[key: string]: number
}

interface ReactionsData {
	path: string
	count: ReactionCount
}
```

I'll put these into the provided `app.d.ts` file that comes with the
SvelteKit skeleton template. The full `src/app.d.ts` file looks like
this:

```ts
// See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#app
// for information about these interfaces
declare global {
	namespace App {
		// interface Error {}
		// interface Locals {}
		// interface PageData {}
		// interface Platform {}
	}

	interface ReactionCount {
		[key: string]: number
	}
	interface ReactionsData {
		path: string
		count: ReactionCount
	}
}

export {}
```

I'll replace the `any` type for `data` in the component and on the
index page with the `ReactionsData` interface. Also in the `load`
function on the `+page.server.ts` file.

## Use enhance

Up till now each time I click a reaction button the page reloads and
the data is fetched from Redis. I'll use the SvelteKit `enhance`
function so there's no page reload each time the buttons are clicked.

I'll expand on the `enhance` function later when I rate limit the
reactions. Here's the `reactions.svelte` component now, with the types
and `enhance` added:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms'
	import { reactions } from '$lib/config'

	export let path: string | null = '/'
	export let data: ReactionsData
</script>

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<form
		method="POST"
		action="/?path={path}"
		use:enhance
		class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
	>
		{#each reactions as reaction}
			<button
				name="reaction"
				type="submit"
				value={reaction.type}
				class="btn btn-primary text-3xl font-bold shadow-xl"
			>
				<span>
					{reaction.emoji}
					{data?.count?.[reaction.type] || 0}
				</span>
			</button>
		{/each}
	</form>
</div>
```

Now I can spam the reaction buttons and the page doesn't reload each
time.

## Rate limit the reactions

So, about that button spamming! I'll add the rate limit to the
`src/routes/+page.server.ts` file.

I'll import Upstash ratelimit which will record the responses from the
current IP address temporarily (15 seconds) in Redis. To ge the IP
address I'll use the `getClientAddress` function from SvelteKit.

If there's more than 10 responses in that time I'll apply the rate
limit and throw an error back to the client. I'll import the SvelteKit
`fail` function to do this.

```ts
import { reactions } from '$lib/config.js'
import { ratelimit, redis } from '$lib/redis.js'
import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const actions = {
	default: async ({ request, url, getClientAddress }) => {
		const ip = getClientAddress()
		const rate_limit_attempt = await ratelimit.limit(ip)

		if (!rate_limit_attempt.success) {
			const time_remaining = Math.floor(
				(rate_limit_attempt.reset - new Date().getTime()) / 1000,
			)

			return fail(429, {
				error: `Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${time_remaining} seconds`,
				time_remaining,
			})
		}

		const data = await request.formData()
		const reaction = data.get('reaction')
		const path = url.searchParams.get('path')

		const redisKey = `${path}:${reaction}`

		const result = await redis.incr(redisKey)

		return {
			success: true,
			status: 200,
			reaction: reaction,
			path: path,
			count: result,
		}
	},
}
```

Now spamming the button on the client I can add ten reactions and then
the count stop incrementing. The only feedback I get that the rate
limit has been applied is the error message in the network tab in the
browser console.

I'll customise the `use:enhance` function in the `reactions.svelte`
component to get the `ActionResult` from the server. For now I'll just
log the result to the console then choose not to reset the form.

```svelte
use:enhance={() => {
	return ({ update, result }) => {
		console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
		update({ reset: false })
	}
}}
```

Now if I spam a reaction button to go over the rate limit I get the
following logged out to the browser console:

```json
{
	"type": "failure",
	"status": 429,
	"data": {
		"error": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 7 seconds",
		"time_remaining": 7
	}
}
```

When I'm not being rate limited the output looks like this:

```json
{
	"type": "success",
	"status": 200,
	"data": {
		"success": true,
		"status": 200,
		"reaction": "parties",
		"path": "/",
		"count": 274
	}
}
```

So I can use the `type` property to check if the response was a
success or failure. If it's a failure I'll disable the buttons for the
time remaining.

For the `time_remaining` that's passed from Redis ratelimit to the
action I need a way to handle the result.

I'll create a Svelte store for `button_disabled` and a `handle_result`
function that will take in the result (`"success"` or `"failure"`) and
set the store to true. After the timeout the store will be set back to
true.

```ts
let button_disabled = writable(false)

const handle_result = (result: ActionResult) => {
	if (result.type === 'failure') {
		$button_disabled = true
		setTimeout(() => {
			$button_disabled = false
		}, result?.data?.time_remaining * 1000)
	}
}
```

In the `use:enhance` function I'll call the `handle_result` function,
then I can set the button `disabled` attribute to the store value.

Here's the full `reactions.svelte` component now:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms'
	import { reactions } from '$lib/config'
	import type { ActionResult } from '@sveltejs/kit'
	import { writable } from 'svelte/store'

	export let path: string | null = '/'
	export let data: ReactionsData

	let button_disabled = writable(false)

	const handle_result = (result: ActionResult) => {
		if (result.type === 'failure') {
			$button_disabled = true
			setTimeout(() => {
				$button_disabled = false
			}, result?.data?.time_remaining * 1000)
		}
	}
</script>

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<form
		method="POST"
		action="/?path={path}"
		use:enhance={() => {
			return ({ update, result }) => {
				handle_result(result)
				console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))
				update({ reset: false })
			}
		}}
		class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5 sm:flex"
	>
		{#each reactions as reaction}
			<button
				name="reaction"
				type="submit"
				value={reaction.type}
				class="btn btn-primary text-3xl font-bold shadow-xl"
				disabled={$button_disabled}
			>
				<span>
					{reaction.emoji}
					{data?.count?.[reaction.type] || 0}
				</span>
			</button>
		{/each}
	</form>
</div>
```

Now spamming the reactions buttons they get disabled and set back to
enabled once the timeout has passed.

## Use the component on a different page

Up until now the component has just been used on the index page. The
intention when I started out doing this is to be able to use the
component on any page.

I'll create an about page and use the component in there, I'll also
need a `+page.server.ts` file to go with the `+page.svelte` file, I'll
create them now with a terminal command.

```bash
mkdir -p src/routes/about
touch src/routes/about/{+page.svelte,+page.server.ts}
```

In the `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` file I'll import the component
and also the SvelteKit page store so I can get the current path.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import Reactions from '$lib/components/reactions.svelte'

	export let data: ReactionsData
	let path = $page.route.id
</script>

<Reactions {data} {path} />
```

In the `src/routes/about/+page.server.ts` file I'll use the same
`load` as what's in the `src/routes/index/+page.server.ts` file.

```ts
export const load = async ({ url: { pathname } }) => {
	const reaction_types = reactions.map(reaction => reaction.type)

	const promises = reaction_types.map(reaction =>
		redis.get(`${pathname}:${reaction}`),
	)
	const results = await Promise.all(promises)

	const count = {} as any
	reaction_types.forEach((reaction, index) => {
		count[reaction] = Number(results[index]) || 0
	})

	return { count }
}
```

Now if I check my Redis database I can see that the reactions for the
about page has been added.

## Refactor page server load and reactions actions üòÖ

Two parts to this refactor, the first is to refactor the page server
load function, the second is to refactor the reactions actions.

The `src/routes/+page.server.ts` load function is now duplicated
across the index page and the about page, it makes sense to refactor
this into a function that can be imported into the `load` function of
any `+page.server.ts` file you want to use it in.

Over in the `src/lib/utils.ts` file I'll create a `get_reaction_count`
function that will take in the `pathname` and return a `ReactionCount`
object.

```ts
import { reactions } from './config'
import { redis } from './redis'

const reaction_types = reactions.map(reaction => reaction.type)

export async function get_reaction_count(
	pathname: string,
): Promise<ReactionCount> {
	const promises = reaction_types.map(reaction =>
		redis.get(`${pathname}:${reaction}`),
	)
	const results = await Promise.all(promises)

	const count = {} as ReactionCount
	reaction_types.forEach((reaction, index) => {
		count[reaction] = Number(results[index]) || 0
	})

	return count
}
```

Then in the `+page.server.ts` files I can import the function and use
it in the `load` function.

```diff
export const load = async ({ url: { pathname } }) => {
+  const count = await get_reaction_count(pathname)
-  const reaction_types = reactions.map(reaction => reaction.type)

-  const promises = reaction_types.map(reaction =>
-    redis.get(`${pathname}:${reaction}`),
-  )
-  const results = await Promise.all(promises)

-  const count = {} as any
-  reaction_types.forEach((reaction, index) => {
-    count[reaction] = Number(results[index]) || 0
-  })

  return { count }
}
```

The server action for adding the reactions to redis is currently on
the index page `src/routes/index/+page.server.ts` file.

I'll move this into it's own folder so it can be better identified.
The `+page.server.ts` file can go into it's own folder, I'll make the
folders for that to go into now:

```bash
# create the folder
mkdir -p src/routes/api/reactions
# copy the index +page.server.ts file into the new folder
cp src/routes/+page.server.ts src/routes/api/reactions/+page.server.ts
```

I'm not going to need the `load` function in this file so I'll remove
it.

In the `src/routes/+page.server.ts` file I'll remove the `actions`
object so there's just the `load` function importing the
`get_reaction_count` from the `src/lib/utils.ts` file.

```ts
import { get_reaction_count } from '$lib/utils.js'

export const load = async ({ url: { pathname } }) => {
	const count = await get_reaction_count(pathname)
	return { count }
}
```

That's it, any code duplication has been taken care of and I've
abstracted out the server action into it's own folder so it can be
quickly identified.

## Conclusion

I successfully created a reactions component with SvelteKit, powered
by Upstash Redis for the data storage, and ensured its fair use with
rate limiting.

I designed this component with the flexibility so it can be added on
any page of a SvelteKit project, this should give an indication of
user engagement for any project it's used on.

This walkthrough, while thorough, only touches the surface of what can
be achieved with SvelteKit and Redis. The most important takeaway for
me is to keep exploring, experimenting and building - because that's
where the real learning happens!

## Example

Ok, I've gone through the steps to create this component. If you just
want to check out the example of the source code you can see the
[example repo on GitHub] and the [live demo].

## Thanks

Thanks to Jamie Barton for giving me the idea for this component where
he does something similar with [Grafbase]. There's also the [Upstash
claps] repo which is a Next.js example.

Thanks to [Geoff Rich] for his great posts on rate limiting with Redis
and SvelteKit on the [Upstash blog].

Also thanks to [Kevin √Öberg Kultalahti] for feedback on the structure
of the project.
