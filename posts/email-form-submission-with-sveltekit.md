</script>

Bit of preamble before I kick this off, subscribers to my newsletter
will know that I've been through a couple of platforms now (Zoho,
SendGrid, Revue then Substack). I settled on Substack because of the
editing experience what I didn't want to settle on was the janky embed
you get with Substack.

Check it out!

  width="100%"
  height="320"
  style="border:1px solid #EEE; background:transparent;"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
></iframe>

Depending on what theme you're using this can potentially be
acceptable, probably not though!

I did get my own custom form working with Substack locally. The
**Tl;Dr** is I popped open the network tab in the browser and made a
note of where the submission was going and checked out the payload so
I could try make a similar submission with Insomnia. This worked
locally! But on deploying to Vercel the submit wasn't working and I
went back to using the Substack embed. Sad times!

## Revue has an open API

Then I remembered that Revue had an open API with docs and everything
so I created an account (I deleted my old one) and used Insomnia to
try out some of the API methods, it worked locally with Insomnia!

So I swapped out the Substack endpoint with the Revue one deployed it
to Vercel and tried it out. I could add new subscribers to my Revue
account! Joy! Ok onto the how to!

## Testing the Revue endpoint

Because Revue has an open API that means there's ‚ú®[documentation]‚ú®

If you're following along you will need your Revue API key, you can
find it at the bottom of the [integrations] page.

Scroll to the bottom and look for something like this:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<br />

Your API key is `2f09ecd9-6a64-4d5b-9c77-a5587cedbcf7`.

Usage of the API must follow Revue's [Terms of Service] and [Privacy Policy].

<br />
</div>

‚ö†Ô∏è Usual warning about exposing API keys here, there doesn't seem to
be a way to generate a new Revue API key, so if it's leaked somewhere
I'm not sure how you'd go about revoking it.

Using Insomnia the first thing I did was check out the POST method
with `https://www.getrevue.co/api/v2/subscribers` the request body was
this:

```json
{
	"email": "spences10apps+test@gmail.com",
	"first_name": "",
	"last_name": "",
	"double_opt_in": false
}
```

As a side note you can add a `+` to the end of an email address in
Gmail to give it a unique name. So in the case of the example `+test`
is what I'm using as a way to identify the email address.

The Bearer token looked like this `Token <your-api-key>`.

Hit Send button and wait for the response! I get a 200 OK with the
preview reply looking something like this:

```json
{
	"id": 5654821249,
	"list_id": 216568,
	"email": "spences10apps+test@gmail.com",
	"first_name": "",
	"last_name": "",
	"last_changed": "2021-08-31T20:10:24.197Z"
}
```

Alright, sweet! I can now add a subscriber to my Revue account via the
Revue API!

## Setup the project

In this example like the last couple of examples I've done I'll be
using Matt Jennings' [SvelteKit blog template]; it's what this site is
based off of.

‚ÑπÔ∏è This is for a SvelteKit project hosted on Vercel, if you're
following along then this is what I'm doing:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mattjennings/sveltekit-blog-template.git
cd sveltekit-blog-template
npm i
```

Matt's example uses the SvelteKit `adapter-static` and because I'm
deploying to Vercel I'll need to install `adapter-vercel` and add that
in the `svelte.config.js`:

```bash
# uninstall adapter-static
npm un @sveltejs/adapter-static
# install adapter-vercel
npm i @sveltejs/adapter-vercel@next
```

Then it's a case of swapping out the first line here `adapter-static`
with `adapter-vercel`:

```js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel'
import { mdsvex } from 'mdsvex'
import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess'
import mdsvexConfig from './mdsvex.config.js'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	extensions: ['.svelte', ...mdsvexConfig.extensions],
	// Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess
	// for more information about preprocessors
	preprocess: [
		mdsvex(mdsvexConfig),
		[
			preprocess({
				postcss: true,
			}),
		],
	],

	kit: {
		target: '#svelte',
		adapter: adapter(),
	},
}

export default config
```

The rest of the config here isn't really pertinent, what matters is
that I have swapped out `adapter-static` with `adapter-vercel` I've
literally copied the code of what I'm working on.

## Setting up environment variables

Because I'm going to be using an API key I don't want exposed there's
a few things I'll need to do!

First is to add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file. For some reason this
isn't in the default skeleton you make with `npm init svelte@next`
project so I'll be adding `.env` to the `.gitignore` file. I'll be
doing this via the terminal, you can edit the file manually if you
like:

```bash
echo .env >> .gitignore
```

SvelteKit uses [Vite] and you can prefix you environment variables
with `VITE_` so they're available to the client (the browser) this
also means that they can be seen from the client.

Although the code for an endpoint runs on the server and adding the
`VITE_` means that you can access the variable in development mode it
_shouldn't_ be exposed to the client **but** I prefer to use
`process.env` to access the variables.

I've made a short post on how to use [`.env` secrets in SvelteKit] if you
need a bit more detail on that.

I'm going to install `env-cmd` and add that to the dev script, first
up install the package:

```bash
npm i -D env-cmd
```

Then add it to the dev script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "env-cmd svelte-kit dev",
```

No I can access environment variables in development mode.

## Setting up the endpoint

Now I'll need to set up the endpoint to submit the email to the Revue
API. I'll do this in the terminal:

```bash
# make the directory
mkdir src/routes/email-submit
# create the file
touch src/routes/email-submit/index.json.js
```

Now for the endpoint `post` function!

Now I can scaffold ou the function to submit the email to the Revue
API.

For now, to test it's worked I'll **hardcode** in the email address to
the `POST` body, then I'll build on that once I've validated it's
working.

```js
export async function post() {
	const REVUE_API_KEY = process.env['REVUE_API_KEY']
	try {
		const res = await fetch(
			'https://www.getrevue.co/api/v2/subscribers',
			{
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					Authorization: `Token ${REVUE_API_KEY}`,
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				},
				body: JSON.stringify({
					email: 'spences10apps+test@gmail.com',
					first_name: '',
					last_name: '',
					double_opt_in: false,
				}),
			},
		)
		if (res.ok) {
			return {
				status: 200,
				body: JSON.stringify({
					message: 'email sent!',
				}),
			}
		}
		if (res.status !== 200) {
			return {
				status: 400,
				body: JSON.stringify({
					message: 'bad request',
				}),
			}
		}
	} catch (error) {
		return {
			status: 500,
			body: JSON.stringify({
				message: 'something went wrong with the email submit!',
			}),
		}
	}
}
```

Nice big wall of text! Like that? Apologies, you could just remove the
error checks and YOLO it if you like, I'm not your mum! üòÇ

So everything is wrapped in a `try` block and if there's an bad
request made to the Revue API then that'll be caught and a response of
`bad request` given.

There's a final catch if the Revue request fails as well.

‚ÑπÔ∏è One thing to note is that I'm not asking for a first or last name
and that I'm not requiring users to double opt in (i.e. reply to
another email to say yes sign me up to the list I've just subscribed
to).

**Note** again, if you didn't catch it earlier, the email address is
hardcoded in here:

```js
body: JSON.stringify({
	email: 'spences10apps+test@gmail.com',
	first_name: '',
	last_name: '',
	double_opt_in: false,
})
```

I'll be changing that once I've validated the submit is working. I
cover that in the [Receive email in endpoint] section.

If you want you can do what you like with these options, my aim is to
remove as much friction as possible.

Sweet! Now that the endpoint is set up I can test it by submitting a
request from a page.

## Setting up the submit form

I'm going to create a sign up component and then use that on the index
page of the project, first I'll create the component in the `lib`
folder:

```bash
touch src/lib/components/submit.svelte
```

Then add the following script to the component:

```svelte
<script>
	let email = ''
	let showMessage = false
	let responseMessage = ''

	async function submitForm() {
		const submit = await fetch('/email-submit.json', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: JSON.stringify({ email }),
		})
		const data = await submit.json()

		if (data.message === 'bad request') {
			showMessage = true
			responseMessage = `That looks like a bad request`
		}
		if (data.message === 'email sent!') {
			showMessage = true
			responseMessage = `Sweet! You're signed up!`
		}
		if (
			data.message === 'something went wrong with the email submit!'
		) {
			showMessage = false
			// deal with failed response from server
		}
	}
</script>
```

So this is setting up the call to the endpoint using the browser fetch
API to the endpoint `/email-submit.json` then setting the `success`
variable if there's no issues.

In the body of the component I'll add the form and the submit button,
the project uses Tailwind so I've added some minimal styles:

```svelte
<div class="mb-10">
	{#if success}
		<div class="text-center">
			<h3 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">{responseMessage}</h3>
		</div>
	{:else}
		<div class="text-center">
			<h3 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">
				Sign up for the newsletter
			</h3>
			<form class="" on:submit|preventDefault={submitForm}>
				<label for="email" class="label">
					<span class="sr-only">Your Email</span>
				</label>
				<input
					id="email"
					aria-label="email"
					type="email"
					name="email"
					autocomplete="email"
					placeholder="your@email.com"
					required
					bind:value={email}
				/>
				<input type="submit" />
			</form>
		</div>
	{/if}
</div>
```

The main part to note here is in the `<form>` element and the call to
`submitForm` via `on:submit|preventDefault={submitForm}`. this is
going to call the `submitForm` function defined in the `<script>` at
the top of the component.

This is all wrapped in a Svelte `{# if}` directive so that there can
be a message displayed with the `showMessage` variable to the user
once they have submitted the form.

Full code from the component here if you need it.

<Details buttonText="submit.svelte code">

```svelte
<script>
	let email = ''
	let showMessage = false
	let responseMessage = ''

	async function submitForm() {
		const submit = await fetch('/email-submit.json', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: JSON.stringify({ email }),
		})
		const data = await submit.json()

		if (data.message === 'bad request') {
			showMessage = true
			responseMessage = `That looks like a bad request`
		}
		if (data.message === 'email sent!') {
			showMessage = true
			responseMessage = `Sweet! You're signed up!`
		}
		if (
			data.message === 'something went wrong with the email submit!'
		) {
			showMessage = false
			// deal with failed response from server
		}
	}
</script>

<div class="mb-10">
	{#if success}
		<div class="text-center">
			<h3 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">{responseMessage}</h3>
		</div>
	{:else}
		<div class="text-center">
			<h3 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">
				Sign up for the newsletter
			</h3>
			<form class="" on:submit|preventDefault={submitForm}>
				<label for="email" class="label">
					<span class="sr-only">Your Email</span>
				</label>
				<input
					id="email"
					aria-label="email"
					type="email"
					name="email"
					autocomplete="email"
					placeholder="your@email.com"
					required
					bind:value={email}
				/>
				<input type="submit" />
			</form>
		</div>
	{/if}
</div>
```

</Details>

## Test the submit

Time to add the sign up form to the index page of the project and hit
submit!

I'll import the `<Submit />` component into `src/routes/index.svelte`
here's what the top of the file looks like for me:

```svelte
<script>
  import ButtonLink from '$lib/components/ButtonLink.svelte'
  import Submit from '$lib/components/submit.svelte'
  import { name } from '$lib/info.js'
  import { format } from 'date-fns'

  export let posts
  export let page

  $: isFirstPage = page === 1
  $: hasNextPage = posts[posts.length - 1]?.previous
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>{name}</title>
</svelte:head>

<Submit />

<div class="flex flex-col flex-grow">
  <!-- rest of the code here -->
```

Now I can enter an email address and hit submit! It doesn't matter
what the email is because it's hardcoded into the endpoint at the
moment!

I'll hit submit and I'll go over to my Revue [subscribers list] and check
to see if the email is there!

![revue-subscribers-list-search]

Sweet! Now I've validated the submit is working I can delete the
subscriber from my [subscribers list] and go about having the endpoint
receive what is submitted from the component!

## Receive email in endpoint

Now all I need to do is add the the `req` parameter to the `post`
function on the `email-submit` endpoint and pull out (destructure) the
`email` from the `req.body`!

```js
export async function post(req) {
  const { email } = JSON.parse(req.body)
  const REVUE_API_KEY = process.env['REVUE_API_KEY']

  try {
    const res = await fetch('https://www.getrevue.co/api/v2/subscribers', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Token ${REVUE_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email,
        first_name: '',
        last_name: '',
        double_opt_in: false
      })
    })
  // rest of the code unchanged
```

## Test it's worked on Vercel

Ok, now time to test it's working when deployed to Vercel! I use the
Vercel CLI so I can push this off from my terminal with once command
`vc` and off it goes!

I've selected the default for all the CLI options, here's what I have:

```bash
‚ûú vc
Vercel CLI 23.0.1
? Set up and deploy "~/repos/svelte-kit-form-submission"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? Scott Spence
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What's your project's name? svelte-kit-form-submission
? In which directory is your code located? ./
Auto-detected Project Settings (SvelteKit):
- Build Command: `npm run build` or `svelte-kit build`
- Output Directory: public
- Development Command: svelte-kit dev --port $PORT
? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n
```

There is one issue however, currently there's no environment variable
for the Revue api set up on Vercel, so if I go to the preview
generated and try submit an email I'll get the bad response message!

From the Vercel project I'll navigate to Settings > Environment
Variables and add in the `REVUE_API_KEY` name and value. Now I can run
the Vercel CLI again and test the form again, wait for the submit then
the Revue [subscribers list] again!

**Success** üéâ

![revue-subscribers-list-search]

## Wrap up!

That's it, I've gone and added an email submit from to a site that
uses the Revue API with SvelteKit endpoints!

I can now use this pattern in other projects!
