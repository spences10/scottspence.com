All the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I use Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview exclusively now.
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has come a long way with WSL2.

If you are intersted in getting familiar with it check the [tags
section for WSL].

- Microphone, a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser Microphone]

Windows Insiders build on the Dev Channel and another partition with
regular release ring for when things don't quite work on the Dev
Channel.
