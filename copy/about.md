## Hi, I'm Scott

<Small>
  Last updated: <DateUpdated date="2024-10-12" small="true" />
</Small>

I'm an application team lead overseeing a large Svelte and SvelteKit
codebase centred around an AI product. My role, leading a team of
super talented developers and ensuring best practices in the
development lifecycle. Prior to this, I was a developer advocate,
partnering with companies to create content that educates users and
streamline their journey.

I create content written in the blog here and educational videos
supporting the written content.

I'm a second career dev that re-skilled from a [VBA] analyst developer
role into web development.

For <DD date="2021-04-06" /> now I have been working in Svelte and
SvelteKit, holding workshops and organising events with the other
organisers of the [Svelte Society London] group.

Check out the [speaking] section for more details about those!

My journey in web development has given me a strong foundation in
modern web standards and best practices. I gained extensive experience
(<DD date="2018-08-02"/>) working with various frameworks and
architectures, including [Gatsby] and the [Jamstack] approach. While I
moved away from active Jamstack usage <DD date="2021-04-06" /> ago,
the principles of performance, security, and scalability I learned
continue to inform my work in creating efficient, user-centric web
applications.

### Sectors I have worked in:

I have over ten years of experience working for large corporate
organisations in Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas
and the Lloyd's insurance market.

As a web developer I've worked in government digital transformation,
creative digital and the content management space. I now work in
business process outsourcing, helping build smart AI agents for
clients.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead, I took the
[16Personalities] test; here are [my results].

I like to think of myself as an easy to approach and friendly person.

### My interests

I'm obsessed with watching anything to do with mechanical engineering
and restorations on YouTube.

I got a Steam Deck! Been playing Borderlands 1, 2 and 3 on it, still
really like the franchise after all this time ðŸ˜Š

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan. I have a Spotify playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/75OcGUSaOXVnOLsFRA9taT?si=0ef1521713074cf9"
  width="100%"
/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be the UKF Drum and Bass Top 100:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/0Zarq4BVkFkZOWkmqsfrjA?si=00e42e2f62174e17"
  width="100%"
/>

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:

**Darknet Diaries**

Stories of cyber threats/breaches that happened on the internet, these
are stories from the past not covering current tech security. Super
interesting to listen to.

<Deezer

/>

**Random But Memorable**

From the makers of 1Password for security advice and a round-up of the
latest security news.

**Land of the Giants**

Stories about big tech and how it's changing the world.
