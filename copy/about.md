## Hi, I'm Scott

I'm a developer relations engineer working with [Storyblok] to create
content that helps remove friction and educate around the headless CMS
space.

I create content written in the blog here and educational videos
supporting the written content.

I'm a second career dev that reskilled from a VBA analyst developer
role into web development.

I have been spending a lot of time working in Svelte and SvelteKit
for, <DateDistance date='2021-04-06' /> now, holding workshops and
organising events in the form of the London Svelte Meetup.

Check out the [speaking] section for more details about those!

I'm a massive fan of the [Jamstack], with a wealth of knowledge
working with [Gatsby] (the React framework).

Also, check out the [portfolio section] for more information.

### Sectors I have worked in:

I have over ten years of experience working for large corporate
organisations in Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas
and Lloyd's insurance market.

As a web developer I've worked in government digital transformation
and creative digital. I now work in the content management space with
Storyblok.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead, I took the
[16Personalities] test; here are [my results].

I like to think of myself as an easy to approach and friendly person.

### My interests

I'm obsessed with watching anything to do with mechanical engineering
and restorations on YouTube.

I play Borderlands 3 on Stadia, then Borderlands 1 and 2 on the
Nintendo Switch.

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan. I have a Spotify playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/75OcGUSaOXVnOLsFRA9taT?si=0ef1521713074cf9"
  width="100%"
/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be the UKF Drum and Bass Top 100:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/0Zarq4BVkFkZOWkmqsfrjA?si=00e42e2f62174e17"
  width="100%"
/>

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:

**Darknet Diaries**

Stories of cyber threats/breaches that happened on the internet, these
are stories from the past not covering current tech security. Super
intersting to listen to.

<Deezer

**Random But Memorable**

From the makers of 1Password for security advice and a round-up of the
latest security news.

**Land of the Giants**

Stories about big tech and how it's changing the world, the latest
series covers the food delivery industry.
