Hello friend 👋, thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile.

I know I'm nothing more than a keyword match right now so let's change
that!

So, first up! I really, _really_ value my time, I have gone to the
effort of putting this information here for _you_ to answer the usual
round of questions you need to ask.

Please, please, try to make it to the end. There's a fair bit of info
here, hopefully everything you need.

There's a lot of _I's_ in this, apologies if it comes off as being
arrogant, I prefer to think of it as being transparent and hope you
see it the same way.

Ok, let's do this!

---

## Are you eligible to work in the UK

Yes.

---

## What's your current situation?

If you want to know if I'm currently employed then, yes, I am.

I'm not actively looking, so, I won't be able to answer the "How are
you finding the market?" question.

I'll always be open to the right position, read on for what that is.
👀

---

## What's my ideal role?

Working in an agile environment using best practices for development.

Working in a _team_ of other developers where there is an emphasis on
technical development.

A good percentage of pair programming on the team.

Working with React, Gatsby, Netlify, Vercel, Next.js and GitHub.

**If you really want to grab my attention,** tell me how you
collaborate, how you keep quality high, how you contribute back to the
community, and how you help your team continue to learn and grow.

I'd like to focus on outcomes and _not_ work hours, what I produce is
what matters and not how long I'm sat at a desk.

Further to that, work life balance is a big deal for me, I really **do
not** want to go over a 37.5 hour working week if presenteeism is a
thing on the team.

Open to contract roles. I have _very_ limited availability so it will
depend on the amount of consulting you need.

---

## What sort of company do you want to work with?

A company that wants their employees to win. This means supporting
learning and encouraging growth.

As a developer it's quite frustrating seeing marketing copy for role
descriptions with the opening line for a company peppered with
buzzwords like AI, Fintech, or being an award winning market leader.

I have no issues with these sort of companies, just the marketing of
them.

I want to know what the work is and how I'll be doing it with my team,
no BS marketing copy please. 🙏

Ethically I don't agree with gambling, that means **no gambling
companies please**.

---

## What's your preferred stack?

I'm _really_ enjoying using the [Jamstack] right now, I have a wealth
of knowledge using [Gatsby] (which uses **React** and **GraphQL**) and
have consulted on large scale apps using it.

I have used using styled-components for many projects, I am also
comforable using Theme UI and Tailwind CSS.

For CMS' any opportunity to work with any of the new headless CMS'
that are emerging would be great: [Sanity.io], [GraphCMS], [Strapi],
[Keystone 5] or [Contentful].

I have commercial experience with Contentful and have built projects
in Sanity.io, GraphCMS and Keystone 5.

For back-end I prefer node which is where the majority of my back-end
experience is.

---

## How many years experience do you have?

<Small>
  These numbers are calculated each time the site is built.
</Small>

JavaScript, HTML and CSS (the holy trinity), <DateDistance
date={`2016-06-15`} />

React, <DateDistance date={`2017-05-20`} />

I have <DateDistance date={`2018-03-14`} /> as a professional web
developer.

I have 11 years previous experience as an analyst developer for
financial organisations.

For more, check out my [about] page which details my experience and a
bit more about me.

## Salary?

In my next permanent role I'm looking for **£60,500**.

I'm run OES Technology where I offer consulting on a contract basis if
you have a project in mind get in touch to discuss.

I'm not giving a number for my _current_ salary because, among other
things, it can be used to cap any offer made to me.

In other words, my old salary becomes what's known in **behavioural
economics** as an anchor.

I know it's in your interest (being the recruiter) to get the best
offer for me. I'll disclose my salary if:

1. You agree not to disclose it to the employer without my express
   permission — no exceptions.
1. You can explain how you're going to use the information for my
   benefit — needs to be a good reason.

---

## Benefits? Yes please!

25+ days holiday a year is ideal.

There's an increasing amount of places that offer "unlimited holiday".
In this circumstance I'd like to know the _minimum_ amount of holiday
that _has_ to be taken annually.

Private healthcare for me and my immediate family.

Gym membership.

---

## Are you willing to relocate?

nop!

I'm happy in sunny, sunny Swanley

---

## Are you willing to work remotely?

Yeah, I mean, the whole industry has been working remotley for the
last twelve months.

I'd prefer not to be bound by any number of days needed to be worked
in an office. Occasional meetings, fine.

I do appreciate the value of working closely with my colleges and I am
comfortable with that using tools like Slack, MS Teams, Zoom etc!

---

## What are your location preferences?

Like I noted already, I'd prefer fully remote roles.

I live a ~30 minute train ride from London stations like Elephant and
Castle, Victoria and Blackfriars. I prefer to avoid travelling by
tube.

I'll consider roles that are a short walk (~10-15 minutes) from either
London Victoria, Blackfriars or Elephant & Castle.

Based in Swanley, Kent I'll consider places that are in Sevenoaks and
Bromley, **only** those two places though.

Please don't contact me about roles in Ashford, Maidstone or anywhere
else deemed "in the same region".

---

## Your skills look like a great match for this position we have!! Can we have a quick five minute phone call to discuss?

Sure book in a [15 minute chat].

**"But I have to talk to you today, my client's deadline is this
afternoon"**, please, book in a [15 minute chat].

Please don't call without a previously agreed time slot, I prefer to
avoid phone calls for these reasons:

1. I'm on a [maker's schedule], which means interruptions are
   disruptive to my flow.
1. I've already tried to answer the most basic questions on this page,
   and I've probably phrased them more clearly here than I will on the
   phone.
1. This question gets asked frequently enough that my default answer
   has to be, if not **"no"**, at least **"[read this first]"**.

**Contact me by email.** That's my preferred means of communication.
If we are still interested after some fact checking I'd love to have a
chat.

> If it's not a HELL YES, it's a NO

Like I mentioned at the start of this FAQ, I _really_ value my time
and the way I make a decision on a commitment is [If it's not a HELL
YES, it's a NO].

Want me to know you have spent more than the **_three seconds_**
nearly all recruiters spend on this page?

In your email mention **"Quick Start Guides Rock!"** and you will have
my attention, gratitude and a guaranteed reply. 🙏

---

## Can I take a look at your CV?

Sure, my CV is here: [mecv.xyz].

The CV uses the [JSON Schema] standard, raw data [here].

---

## Do you have your CV in PDF/MS Word format?

No.

The link to my CV is my product and brand, as it was built and styled
by me. I consider this a way to showcase my current skill level. If
your client wants to see my CV give them the link.

I understand that a lot of companies will have ATS that you need to
add a document to. I'll leave this part of _your job_ up to you.

---

## Notice period?

[Two weeks].

---

## Interview availability?

I can telephone interview with little notice.

I can video call with prior arrangement.

Please be upfront about timings for interview rounds. I'm not
interested in several day long rounds.

With regard to technical/take home 'tests', I'm not willing to spend
more than two hours on any given assignment to assess my skill level.

The effort exchange for take homes doesn't seem quite right to me. A
one hour interview in real time would be preferred.
