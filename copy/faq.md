Hello friend üëã, thanks for taking an interest in me and my profile.

I know I'm nothing more than a keyword match right now, so let's
change that!

So, first up! I really, _really_ value my time, I have gone to the
effort of putting this information here for _you_ to answer the usual
round of questions you need to ask.

Please, please, try to make it to the end. There's a fair bit of info
here, hopefully everything you need.

There's a lot of _I's_ in this, apologies if it comes off as being
arrogant, I prefer to think of it as being transparent and hope you
see it the same way.

Ok, let's do this!

---

## Are you eligible to work in the UK

Yes.

---

## What's your current situation?

If you want to know if I'm currently employed then, yes, I am.

I'm not actively looking, so, I won't be able to answer the "How are
you finding the market?" question.

I'll always be open to the right position, read on for what that is.
üëÄ

## What's my ideal role?

Creating educational content in the form of conference and meetup
talks, videos, blog posts and workshops.

Working in a _team_ of other developers where there is an emphasis on
technical development.

A good percentage of pair programming and collaboration on the team.

Working with Svelte and SvelteKit, Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub.

**If you really want to grab my attention,** tell me how you
collaborate, how you keep quality high, how you contribute back to the
community, and how you help your team continue to learn and grow.

I'd like to focus on outcomes and _not_ work hours, what I produce is
what matters and not how long I'm sat at a desk.

Further to that, work life balance is a big deal for me, I really **do
not** want to go over a 37.5 hour working week if presenteeism is a
thing on the team.

I work on a contract basis for OES Technology, I'd prefer to work with
companies outside of the UK in a 'full time' fully remote capacity.

If you're in the UK and have a project in mind that will not be full
time [get in touch] to discuss.

---

## What sort of company do you want to work with?

A company that wants their employees to win. This means supporting
learning and encouraging growth.

As a developer it's quite frustrating seeing marketing copy for role
descriptions with the opening line for a company peppered with
buzzwords like AI, Fintech, or being an award winning market leader.

I have no issues with these sort of companies, just the marketing of
them.

I want to know what the work is and how I'll be doing it with my team,
no BS marketing copy please. üôè

Ethically I don't agree with gambling, that means **no gambling
companies please**.

---

## What's your preferred stack?

I'm _really_ enjoying working with Svelte and SvelteKit and I'll be
very interested in roles that are using it.

Tailwind is my current preference for the speed which it offers when
creating projects. I have also used styled-components for many
projects in the past.

I have a wealth of knowledge using [Gatsby] (2017-2020) (which uses
**React** and **GraphQL**) and have consulted on large scale projects
using it.

For CMS' any opportunity to work with any of the new headless CMS'
that are emerging would be great: [Storyblok], [Hygraph], [Sanity.io],
[Strapi], [Keystone 5] or [Contentful].

I have commercial experience with Hygraph and Contentful and have
built projects in Sanity.io and Keystone 5.

For back-end I prefer node which is where the majority of my back-end
experience is.

---

## How many years experience do you have?

<Small>
  These numbers are calculated each time the page loads.
</Small>

JavaScript, HTML and CSS (the holy trinity), <DD date='2016-06-15' />.

Svelte, <DD date='2021-04-06' />. I host regular workshops on Svelte
and SvelteKit you can find in the [speaking] section of this site.

React, <DD date='2017-05-20' />.

I have <DD date='2018-03-14' /> experience as a professional web
developer and <DD date='2021-04-21' /> as a developer advocate.

I have 10+ years previous experience as an analyst developer for
financial organisations.

For more, check out my [about] page which details my experience and a
bit more about me.

## Salary?

As I mentioned earlier I run OES Technology where I offer consulting
on a contract basis. If you have a project in mind [get in touch] to
discuss.

Want me to come on board on a contract basis? Sweet! I'm open to that!
Depending on the setup I'd be looking for a day rate of **‚Ç¨397** or
monthly rate of **~‚Ç¨11,910** (day rate times 30). The rate has been
calculated with holidays and public holidays built in.

---

## Benefits? Yes please!

30+ days holiday a year is ideal.

There's an increasing amount of places that offer "unlimited holiday".
In this circumstance I'd like to know the _minimum_ amount of holiday
that _has_ to be taken annually.

Private healthcare for me and my immediate family.

Gym membership.

---

## Are you willing to relocate?

nop!

I'm happy in sunny, sunny Swanley

---

## Are you willing to work remotely?

I think the question now should be, are you willing to come into the
office!

Yeah, I mean, the whole industry has been working remotely since 2020
now.

I'd prefer not to be bound by any number of days needed to be worked
in an office. Occasional meetings, fine.

I do appreciate the value of working closely with my colleagues and I
am comfortable with that using tools like Google Meet, Slack, MS
Teams, Zoom etc!

---

## What are your location preferences?

Like I noted already, I'd prefer fully remote roles.

I live a ~30 minute train ride from London stations like Elephant and
Castle, Victoria, Blackfriars and Charring Cross.

I'll consider roles that are a short walk (~10-15 minutes) from any of
those stations.

Based in Swanley, Kent I'll consider places that are in Sevenoaks and
Bromley, **only** those two places though.

Please don't contact me about roles in Ashford, Maidstone or anywhere
else deemed "in the same region".

---

## Your skills look like a great match for this position we have!! Can we have a quick five minute phone call to discuss?

Sure, book in a [15 minute chat].

**"But I have to talk to you today, my client's deadline is this
afternoon"**, please, book in a [15 minute chat].

Please don't call without a previously agreed time slot, I don't
answer my phone if I'm not expecting a call.

I prefer to avoid phone calls for these reasons:

1. I'm on a [maker's schedule], which means interruptions are disruptive
   to my flow.
1. I've already tried to answer the majority of questions asked on
   this page. I've probably phrased them more clearly here than I will
   on the phone.

**Contact me by email.** That's my preferred means of communication.
If we are still interested after some fact checking I'd love to have a
chat.

> If it's not a HELL YES, it's a NO

Like I mentioned at the start of this FAQ, I _really_ value my time
and the way I make a decision on a commitment is [If it's not a HELL
YES, it's a NO].

Want me to know you you have taken the time to read this FAQ?

In your email mention **"Quick Start Guides Rock!"** and you will have
my attention, gratitude and a guaranteed reply. üôè

---

## Can I take a look at your CV?

Sure, my CV is here: [mecv.xyz].

Most of the pertinent stuff you want to know is covered here, really.

---

## Do you have your CV in PDF/MS Word format?

Sure, hit the download button on [mecv.xyz].

---

## Notice period?

My current contract stipulates 30 days notice.

---

## Interview availability?

I can telephone interview with little notice.

I can video call with prior arrangement.

Please be upfront about timings for interview rounds. I'm not
interested in taking part in several day long interview rounds.

With regard to technical/take home 'tests', I'm not willing to spend
more than an hour on any given assignment to assess my skill level
unless I'm being paid for my time.

The effort exchange for take home assignments isn't right. A one hour
interview in real time would be preferred.
