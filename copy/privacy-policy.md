# Privacy Policy

</Small>

Hello, welcome to the privacy policy for [scottspence.com](), I want
to be transparent about anything this site collects from you and what
I use it for.

The privacy policy in this site includes these points:

- [How I collect your information]
- [What I do with collected information]
- [What cookies, pixels, and other trackers my site uses and their purpose]
- [Any advertising networks and their methods/purposes of
  data collection and ad delivery]
- [How users of this site can op-in and op-out of their data being
  collected and stored]
- [How users of this site can request their data be turned over to
  them and/or be deleted]
- [Contact information for site administrators]

### How I collect your information

The only piece of information I collect is your email address _if_ you
sign up to receive email updates from me.

I use Buttondown to capture your email address when you give it
voluntarily via the email sign up form, you can see their privacy
statement [here][0].

The information collected is an email address with no other personal
identifying information.

### What I do with collected information

I use the collected information (an email address) to send emails to
subscribers.

If there is a giveaway being run where I need to send something in the
post, like stickers. I will request your address via the email given
in the mailing list on Buttondown. Once the package has been sent I
will delete any emails with identifying information in them.

### What cookies, pixels, and other trackers my site uses and their purpose.

Ok, cookies! On [scottspence.com](), I use cookies, but keep it
simple. I use a cookie to remember your theme choice, that's it.

The **theme** cookie is like a handy helper that knows your theme
preference every time you drop by. No fuss. If you don't change then
theme then no cookie is set.

You can find more about them both in the
[Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy).

I use Fathom Analytics to measure page visits to [scottspence.com](),
they use no cookies, no trackers, you can view the Fathom Analytics
privacy statement [here][1].

### Any advertising networks and their methods/purposes of data collection and ad delivery.

I don't use any advertising networks on my site, they all suck!

### How users of this site can op-in and op-out of their data being collected and stored.

<!-- cSpell:ignore pecr,ccpa,coppa -->

The data collected by Fathom Analytics is cookieless and is compliant
with GDPR, ePrivacy, PECR, CCPA, and COPPA.

Browsing data is not being sent to any big tech companies to be sold
off.

If you do not want to send anonymous aggregated data to Fathom
Analytics you can opt out from the console on this site.

To open the console in the browser use the following key combinations
**Control+Shift+J in Windows/Linux** or **Command+Option+J on macOS**

Use the following snippet to block tracking:

```js
fathom.blockTrackingForMe()
```

If you wish to re-enable it use this:

```js
fathom.enableTrackingForMe()
```

### How users of this site can request their data be turned over to them and/or be deleted

As I only collect email addresses for the purposes of the newsletter
you can unsubscribe from the mails sent anytime.

If you want to contact me see [Contact information for
site administrators] and I will personally remove your email address
from Buttondown.
