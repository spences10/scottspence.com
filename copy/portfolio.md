I'm Scott, a passionate Svelte ambassador and application team lead
with <DateDistance date='2018-03-18' /> years of commercial experience
in web development. Currently, I'm an engineering lead developing an
AI-focused product built with Svelte and SvelteKit. My work spans
practical utilities, developer tools, and useless projects I've built,
just, because!

Here's some of my recent work.

## Devhub CRM

[![devhub.party screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/defkmsrpw/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1761763547/545b587f-6f2d-44f3-832a-620286903029.png)](https://devhub.party)

A developer-first relationship management platform that solves the
core problem developers face with traditional CRMs: they hate manual
data entry and generic tools don't fit their unique workflow. Built
from the ground up for how developers actually manage relationships -
through GitHub, conferences, and open source communities.

**Key Features:**

- GitHub Quick Connect for seamless contact import from your
  development network
- Core CRM functionality including contacts, interactions, follow-ups,
  and notes
- Relationship health scoring to track connection strength
- Public developer profiles with QR codes for easy networking at
  conferences

**Impact:**

Designed specifically for conference networking, open source
maintainers, developer advocates, and freelancers who need to manage
developer relationships without the overhead of traditional CRMs.

**Tech Stack:** SvelteKit, Svelte 5, TypeScript, SQLite, sqlite-vec,
Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, Better Auth

## Sveltest

[![sveltest.dev screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/defkmsrpw/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1749636807/scottspence.com/8502f304-39bc-43d4-9819-6d0d12542b66.png)](https://sveltest.dev)

A weekend project that evolved into a comprehensive testing resource
for the Svelte ecosystem, now influencing how modern Svelte
applications approach testing in real browser environments. Originally
created as a companion to my blog post about
[Migrating from @testing-library/svelte to vitest-browser-svelte](https://scottspence.com/posts/migrating-from-testing-library-svelte-to-vitest-browser-svelte),
Sveltest has become a community-driven resource built by developers,
for developers.

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive testing documentation and real-world examples using
  vitest-browser-svelte
- Pre-configured AI assistant rules for Cursor and Windsurf that
  enforce testing best practices automatically
- Multi-layer testing approach with minimal mocking - shared
  validation logic, real FormData/Request objects, and TypeScript
  contracts
- Lots, and I mean lots of testing scenarios
- Battle-tested patterns from production environments using
  bleeding-edge Svelte 5 and vitest-browser-svelte

**Impact:**

The project has influenced testing methodologies across the Svelte
ecosystem, with patterns now being adopted by teams working on
large-scale production applications. The comprehensive AI assistant
rules help entire teams adopt consistent testing patterns, whether
using Cursor, Windsurf, or other AI-powered editors.

**Tech Stack:** SvelteKit, TypeScript, Vitest, vitest-browser-svelte,
Playwright, TailwindCSS, daisyUI
