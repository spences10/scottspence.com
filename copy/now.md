### Work

Working with [XtendOps] as an application team lead overseeing a large
Svelte and SvelteKit codebase. My role revolves around leading a team
of talented developers and ensuring best practices in the development
lifecycle.

### Play

I got me a Steam Deck! Was playing the Death Stranding Director's Cut,
now playing Borderlands 4 (yes on the Steam Deck).
