# Newsletter Format Guide

## Title Format

**Pattern:** `[Playful Title] - [Month Year]`

**Examples:**

- "The one where I broke SQLite - October 2025"
- "Ship it and iterate - September 2025"
- "Learning in public - August 2025"

## Required Structure

### 1. Opening Prose (No Heading)

### 2. Highlights Section

lists. No H3 subheadings.

### 3. Blog Posts

### 4. Open Source (If Applicable)

Brief paragraph on contributions worth mentioning.

### 5. Closing Prose (No Heading)

Brief sign-off (1-2 sentences).

**Target length:** 400-600 words. Shorter is better.

## Common Issues to Flag
