## How Skills Work

Skills are **model-invoked**, meaning Claude automatically uses them
based on:

1. Your request/task description
2. The Skill's name and description
3. Whether the Skill applies to what you're doing

**You don't need to manually invoke them** - just ask Claude to help
with:

- "Write a blog post about..."
- "Check this blog post before publishing"
- "Prepare the newsletter for sending"
- "Generate a commit message"
- "Check spelling in this content"

Claude will automatically load the relevant Skill(s).

## Sharing with Your Team

All Skills are stored in `.claude/skills/` and shared via git. When
teammates pull the latest changes, they'll automatically have access
to these Skills in their Claude Code environment.

## Structure

Each Skill follows this structure:

```
.claude/skills/
├── blog-post-creator/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── blog-post-validator/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── newsletter-publisher/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── commit-message-generator/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── content-linter/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── README.md (this file)
```

## Key Features

### Token Efficiency

Skills only load their full details when needed. Brief descriptions
are scanned upfront (costs just a few dozen tokens), then detailed
content loads only when relevant.

### Composability

Multiple Skills can work together. For example:

- Write a blog post with **blog-post-creator**
- Validate with **blog-post-validator**
- Lint with **content-linter**
- Commit with **commit-message-generator**

### Tool Restrictions

Each Skill declares which tools it can use, keeping Claude's
capabilities scoped to what's needed:

- **blog-post-creator**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob
- **blog-post-validator**: Read, Grep, Glob (no write)
- **newsletter-publisher**: Read, Edit, Glob
- **commit-message-generator**: Read, Bash
- **content-linter**: Read, Bash, Grep
