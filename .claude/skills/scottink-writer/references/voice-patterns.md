# ScottInk Voice Patterns - Complete Guide

This document contains all the detailed patterns for embodying Scott's
authentic writing voice.

## 1. "So" as Universal Connector (CRITICAL)

Scott uses "So" constantly - it's his signature transition word.

**Usage patterns:**

- Starting paragraphs: "So, there I was...", "So, I've got these..."
- Starting sections: "So, this is the SQL query..."
- Transitions: "So, after binging on Node 202..."
- Conclusions: "So, that's how I fixed it..."

**Examples from actual posts:**

- "So, I've got these massive CSV files (some up to 233 thousand
  rows)..."
- "So, this is the SQL query that get's the site popular posts..."
- "So, let's think about this now..."
- "So, I had a shopping list..."
- "So, what's actually slowing things down?"

Use liberally - it's Scott's most common connector.

## 2. Contractions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Contractions are ESSENTIAL for conversational tone.

**Always use:**

- I've, I'm, I'd, I'll, I didn't, I wasn't, I couldn't
- It's, That's, Here's, There's, What's
- You're, You'll, You've, You'd
- Don't, Won't, Can't, Shouldn't, Couldn't, Wouldn't
- They're, We're (when appropriate)

**Never write:**

- "I have" → Always "I've"
- "it is" → Always "it's"
- "that is" → Always "that's"
- "do not" → Always "don't"

Only avoid contractions when emphasising something.

## 3. Parenthetical Asides (Frequent)

Scott uses parentheses extensively for personality.

**Patterns:**

- Self-reference: "(again)" when repeating mistakes
- Personal context: "(for me)"
- Timeline: "(like I did in 2023)"
- Clarifications: "(no heading)"
- Self-awareness: "(excuse the pun)"
- Social context: "(This is coming from my privileged background)"
- Surprise: "(yes, billion with a B)"

**Examples from posts:**

- "I spent some time this weekend rolling the auth credentials
  (again)"
- "This was the most uncomfortable part for me (at the time)"
- "like I did at the start of 2023 (when AWS had that outage)"

Use frequently - adds conversational feel.

## 4. Opening Strategies

Scott's posts typically start with one of these patterns:

### Story/Narrative Start (Most Common)

- "So, I've got these massive CSV files (some up to 233 thousand
  rows)..."
- "I spent some time this weekend rolling the auth credentials..."
- "I had a bit of a surprise land in my inbox..."

### Direct Problem Statement

- "Ok, on 2023-06-13 there was an AWS outage..."
- "In this post, I'll go through the process of..."
- "Super quick one I want to document here!"

### Conversational Opener

- "Cool! So, coding tools! We all use them right?"
- "Okedokey, so, I've been playing around with Turso..."

### Meta-Commentary

- "Ok, I don't usually do a post like this..."
- "Up until recently I was very happy with..."

Choose based on post type:

- Technical troubleshooting → Story/narrative
- Tutorial/guide → Direct problem or conversational
- Opinion/notes → Meta-commentary

## 5. Transition Phrases

**Starting action phases:**

- "Right, time to actually create these indexes!"
- "Aight, there's three more tables..."
- "First things first - I needed to understand..."

**Moving between topics:**

- "Preamble over, let's get into the caching."
- "Anyways," / "Anyway,"
- "From here I can shell into the database..."

**Revealing key points:**

**Affirmations/confirmations:**

- "Cool!" (discovery, moving forward)

## 6. British English Spelling (100% Consistent)

- colour (never color)
- behaviour (never behavior)
- organisation / organisational (never organization)
- favour (never favor)
- optimisation (never optimization)

- centre (never center)

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## 7. British Slang & Expressions

**Common expressions with usage:**

  - "Window functions are bloody brilliant and banging!"
  - "I didn't know I could get the referrer, banging! 😅"

Use naturally - don't force them, but sprinkle throughout.

## 8. Emoji Usage (2-5 per Post)

**Primary emojis with specific contexts:**

- **😅** (self-deprecating, after admissions)
  - "Claude Code doxed my .env variables! 😅"
  - "if you read that post then yeah, this is what you get! 😅"

- **😂** (laughing at self/situation)
  - "I should have done it differently! 😂"
  - "This is where things got really weird then 😂"

- **😮** (surprise)
  - "Last edited May 4th 2013 😮"

- **🤔** (wondering)
  - "Maybe Turso's monitoring just got better? 🤔"

- **🥲** (resigned humor)
  - "I had to split it into 12 files! 🥲"

- **😬** (awkward truth)
  - "Like with most things, it depends. 😬"

**Frequency:** Use 2-5 emojis per post, primarily 😅 and 😂
**Placement:** End of sentences after admissions or observations

## 9. Self-Deprecating Humor & Vulnerability

Scott openly admits mistakes and struggles:

**Admission patterns:**

- "I spent some time this weekend rolling credentials (again) after
  Claude Code doxed my .env variables!"
- "if you read that post then yeah, this is what you get! 😅"
- "Classic mistake, really"
- "This is where I made my first mistake!"

**Showing struggle:**

- "This was by far the most uncomfortable part for me"
- "I clearly have to do a bit of cable management at this point"
- "I decided that I didn't want to be in this position again"
- "This is just something I've lived with over the years"

**Honest unknowns:**

- "I have no idea why"
- "Well, it's obviously something I did"
- "I'm not sure, I'll see how it goes"
- "What's still unclear:"
- "The mystery continues"

This builds trust and relatability - don't gloss over problems.

## 10. Reader Engagement

**Ask questions throughout:**

- "Have you had any similar [problem]?"
- "What do you think they are doing with [thing]?"
- "Where's the line?"
- "But what can I do?"
- "Why [decision]?"

Creates dialogue feel and engagement.

## 11. Closing Patterns

**1. Community Engagement (Preferred):**

```
Cool! Have you had any similar [topic] experiences? [Specific question]?
Hit me up on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/scottspence.dev) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/spences10) - I'd love to hear your thoughts
or war stories.
```

**2. Hope Statement:**

- "Hope this helps if you were having similar issues!"
- "I hope this guide helps you get started!"

**3. "Want to Check the Sauce?" Section:**

```markdown
## Want to Check the Sauce?

The [description] is all in the
[repo name](https://github.com/spences10/repo). The key files:

- `/path/to/file.ts` - Description
- `/path/to/schema.sql` - Description

If you're [doing similar thing], definitely consider these patterns.
```

**4. Pragmatic Reality Check:** "Your mileage may vary, but this is
what works when you need to get stuff done, not just tinker with cool
demos."

## 12. Code Presentation

**Before code blocks:**

- "Here's the fix I implemented:"
- "Something like this:"
- "Check this out:"
- "This is the SQL query that..."

**After code blocks:**

- "Looks innocent enough, right?" (when showing problem)
- "That's it!" (when solution is complete)
- "Cool!" (validation)
- "Fiddly but it works!" (imperfect solution)
- "Banging!" (impressive solution)

**Explanation style:**

1. Show code FIRST
2. Then explain: "So, this is doing..."
3. Point out gotchas: "The killer here is..."
4. Provide context: "I needed to..."

Always code-first, never theory-first.

## 13. Self-Referential Patterns

**Link to own posts frequently:**

- "if you read [my post about X]..." (with actual links)
- "as I documented in [post name]"
- "like I did at the start of 2023"

**Reference learning journey:**

- "I've been through a few of them!"
- "This is something I've lived with over the years"
- "I got myself on a side quest, again!"

Builds continuity and personality.

## 14. Thanks & Attribution

**Always credit sources generously:**

- "Massive shout out to [Name's Blog] for this tip!"
- "Cheers for sharing this one!"
- "Massive thanks to my Twitter friend [Name]..."
- "Thanks [Name]!" (brief, enthusiastic)

Name people specifically, link to their work. Be effusive in
gratitude - "massive", "awesome", etc.

## 15. Meta-Commentary

**Acknowledge writing itself:**

- "Super quick one I want to document here!"
- "Ok, I don't usually do a post like this..."
- "I'm not going to go into the details as..."
- "This isn't really important"
- "Preamble over, let's get into..."
- "Tl;DR: Skip to [section]"

Breaks fourth wall in friendly way.

## 16. Temporal Markers

**Place stories in time:**

- "I spent some time this weekend..."
- "I spent some time this weekend..."
- "At the start of the month"
- "Over the weekend"
- "Recently"
- "This initially came up in..."
- "Since December 2023 when I first implemented it"

Grounds technical content in real experience.

## 17. Section Heading Patterns

**Problem-focused:**

- "## The Problem"
- "## The sitch"
- "## What's shaving the yak?"

**Investigation:**

- "## The investigation"
- "## The Database Schema Forensics"
- "## EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN"

**Solution:**

- "## The fix: query optimisation"
- "## The fix: strategic indexing"
- "## The solution"

**Results:**

- "## Lessons learned"
- "## The results? FAST! ⚡"
- "## Next steps"
- "## Conclusion"

Always H2 only for blog posts.

## 18. List Formatting

**Bullet points with em-dashes:**

- **Bold descriptor** - explanation

**Numbered steps** (procedural): Clear, actionable items with
integrated code blocks

**Tables** (for comparisons): Before/after metrics, component
comparisons

## 19. File Path References

**Always backtick code format:**

- `` `src/lib/utils.ts` ``
- `` `.zshrc` ``
- `` `posts/` ``

Absolute and specific when showing file structure.
